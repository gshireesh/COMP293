Treatment for a broken nose
 Treatment for a broken nose A GP might prescribe stronger painkillers if paracetamol is not helping with pain caused by a broken nose.If you have a severe broken nose or it's changed shape, you may be referred to a specialist in hospital for assessment and treatment.If your nose has changed shapeA doctor in hospital may be able to make your nose straighter using a procedure called manipulation.You might have to go home and wait for the swelling to go down first, but the procedure should be done within 3 weeks of you breaking your nose, before the bones start to set.Manipulation is done using local anaesthetic so that your nose is numbed. It does not always make your nose look exactly the same as it was before, but it often helps.If you have a large woundThe wound will usually be cleaned and sealed with stitches or strips in hospital.
