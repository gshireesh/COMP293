 Vasculitis is the name of a group of conditions that cause inflammation of the blood vessels.Inflammation is your immune system's natural response to injury or infection. It causes swelling and can help the body deal with invading germs.But in vasculitis, for some reason the immune system attacks healthy blood vessels, causing them to become swollen and narrow.This may be triggered by an infection, another underlying condition, or a medicine, although often the cause is unknown.Vasculitis can range from a minor problem that just affects the skin, to a more serious illness that causes problems with organs like the heart or kidneys.There are many types of vasculitis. The rest of this page discusses a range of potential causes.
