Why an adenoidectomy is done
 Why an adenoidectomy is done An adenoidectomy is mainly done in children to help with problems caused by enlarged adenoids.These problems can cause pain or partially block the airway. They include:difficulty breathing through the nose, which can cause mouth breathing or snoringsleep apnoea, where breathing stops and starts during sleepglue ear, an infection in the middle ear which can cause hearing problemsfrequent ear infectionsThe adenoids usually start to shrink around the age of 4 and disappear by early adulthood.Your doctor might suggest waiting to see if these problems get better by themselves rather than having an adenoidectomy, depending on how serious the problems are.An adenoidectomy may be done in adults who have these problems, but this is not common.

The hospital will give you information about this.The operation is usually done as a day case. This means your child should be able to go home on the same day once they're well enough.It's done under general anaesthetic, so they'll be asleep during the operation and will not feel any pain. It usually takes about 30 minutes.The surgeon removes the adenoids through the mouth. They will either be carefully cut out or removed using special tools that apply heat or radio frequency energy.Dissolvable stitches may be used to stop any bleeding.The process is the same for adults having an adenoidectomy.An adenoidectomy may be done at the same time as a tonsil removal (adenotonsillectomy) or surgery to put a small tube in the ear to drain fluid (grommet surgery).After the operationYour child will spend some time in the recovery room and have medicine to help with pain and swelling.After the operation they may:feel sickhave a blocked nosehave a sore throat and sore earshave a temporary change to their voice – it may sound like they are talking through their nosehave bad breath
