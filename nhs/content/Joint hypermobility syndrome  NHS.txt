 Information: Read more about assessing joint hypermobility with the Beighton scoring system on the Ehlers-Danlos Society website.

Do gentle exercise – start with low-impact exercise like swimming or cycling if you've not been active before (not doing any exercise can make your symptoms worse) maintain a healthy weight wear supportive shoes wear special insoles (orthotics) in your shoes if a podiatrist has recommended them Don’t do not overextend your joints just because you can do not do repetitive exercises or activities – take regular breaks (called pacing) 
What causes joint hypermobility syndrome
 What causes joint hypermobility syndrome Joint hypermobility syndrome can run in families and it cannot be prevented.Usually, the joints are loose and stretchy because the ligaments that should make them stronger and support them are weak.The weakness is because the collagen that strengthens the ligaments is different from other people's.Most experts agree that joint hypermobility syndrome is part of a spectrum of hypermobility disorders which includes Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.
