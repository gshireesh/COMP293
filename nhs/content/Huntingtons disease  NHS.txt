 How it's inheritedHuntington's disease is caused by a faulty gene that results in parts of the brain becoming gradually damaged over time.You're usually only at risk of developing it if one of your parents has or had it. Both men and women can get it.If a parent has the Huntington's disease gene, there's a:1 in 2 (50%) chance of each of their children developing the condition – affected children are also able to pass the gene to any children they have1 in 2 (50%) chance of each of their children never developing the condition – unaffected children can't pass the condition on to any children they haveVery occasionally, it's possible to develop Huntington's disease without having a history of it in your family. But this is usually just because one of your parents was never diagnosed with it.
