 Puberty is when a child's body begins to develop and change as they become an adult.Signs of puberty include girls developing breasts and starting periods, and boys developing a larger penis and testicles, a deeper voice and a more muscular appearance.The average age for girls to start puberty is 11, while for boys the average age is 12.But it's perfectly normal for puberty to begin at any point between the ages of 8 and 13 in girls and 9 and 14 in boys.There's not usually any need to worry if puberty does not start around the average age, but it's a good idea to speak to your GP for advice if it starts before 8 or has not started by around 14.In some cases, early puberty or delayed puberty could be a sign of an underlying condition that may need to be treated.
