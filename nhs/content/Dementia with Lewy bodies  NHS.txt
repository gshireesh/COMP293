Outlook for dementia with Lewy bodies
 Outlook for dementia with Lewy bodiesHow quickly dementia with Lewy bodies gets worse varies from person to person.Home-based help will usually be needed, and some people will eventually need care in a care home.The average survival time after diagnosis is around 5 to 7 years. But this is highly variable and some people live much longer than this.If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with dementia, remember that you're not alone. The NHS and social services, as well as voluntary organisations, can provide advice and support for you and your family. 
Causes of dementia with Lewy bodies
 Causes of dementia with Lewy bodiesDementia with Lewy bodies is caused by clumps of protein forming inside brain cells. These abnormal deposits are called Lewy bodies.These deposits are also found in people with Parkinson's disease, and they build up in areas of the brain responsible for functions such as thinking, visual perception and muscle movement.It's not clear why the deposits develop and how exactly they damage the brain. It's thought that part of the problem is the proteins affecting the brain's normal functions by interfering with signals sent between brain cells.Dementia with Lewy bodies usually occurs in people with no family history of the condition, although there have been very rare cases that seem to run in families.
