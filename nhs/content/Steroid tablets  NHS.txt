How steroid tablets work
 How steroid tablets workSteroids closely copy the effects of hormones normally produced by the adrenal glands, which are 2 small glands found above the kidneys.When taken in doses higher than the amount your body normally produces, steroids reduce redness and swelling (inflammation). This can help with inflammatory conditions such as asthma and arthritis.Steroids also reduce the activity of the immune system, the body's natural defence against illness and infection.This can help treat autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, which are caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the body.Steroid tablets are different from the anabolic steroids used illegally by some people to increase their muscle mass.
