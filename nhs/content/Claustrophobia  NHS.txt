 Claustrophobia is the irrational fear of confined spaces.People affected by claustrophobia will often go out of their way to avoid confined spaces, such as lifts, tunnels, tube trains and public toilets. But avoiding these places may reinforce the fear.Some people with claustrophobia experience mild anxiety when in a confined space, while others have severe anxiety or a panic attack.It's estimated around 10% of the UK population are affected by claustrophobia during their lifetime.

Coping with a panic attack
 Coping with a panic attackIf possible, stay where you are during a panic attack. It could last up to an hour, so if you're driving, you may need to pull over and park where it's safe to do so. Do not rush to a place of safety.During the attack, remind yourself that the frightening thoughts and sensations are a sign of panic and will eventually pass.Focus on something non-threatening and visible, such as the time passing on your watch or items in a supermarket.The symptoms of a panic attack usually peak within 10 minutes, with most attacks lasting between 5 and 30 minutes.Get more advice on coping with a panic attack
