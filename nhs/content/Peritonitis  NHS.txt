Causes of peritonitis
 Causes of peritonitis The lining of the tummy (peritoneum) covers internal organs like the kidneys, liver and bowel.If the lining becomes infected and you get peritonitis, the internal organs it covers can also be damaged.This most often happens because of things like:a burst stomach ulcera burst appendixdigestive problems, such as Crohn's disease or diverticulitispancreatitissurgeryinjury to the stomachpelvic inflammatory diseasecirrhosisRarely, if bacteria gets into peritoneal dialysis equipment used to treat people with kidney failure, this can cause infection. 
Treatment for peritonitis
 Treatment for peritonitis If you're diagnosed with peritonitis, you'll need treatment in hospital to get rid of the infection.Treatment usually involves being given antibiotics into a vein (intravenously).If you have regular kidney dialysis, your doctor might discuss a different way of doing it until the peritonitis has been treated.Help with eating during treatmentIt can be difficult to digest food if you have peritonitis.A feeding tube might be passed into your stomach through your nose or placed inside your stomach using keyhole surgery.If a feeding tube cannot be used, liquid nutrients can be given directly into one of your veins.Surgery for peritonitisIf part of your stomach lining has been seriously damaged by infection, you may need surgery to remove it.Sometimes pus-filled swellings (abscesses) develop in the lining and need to be drained with a needle under local anaesthetic.You might also need an operation to deal with the cause of the peritonitis. For example, a burst appendix will need to be removed.
