 Brugada syndrome is a rare but serious condition that affects the way electrical signals pass through the heart.It can cause the heart to beat dangerously fast. These unusually fast heartbeats – known as an arrhythmia – can sometimes be life threatening.Brugada syndrome is usually caused by a faulty gene that's inherited by a child from a parent. A simple heart test can be done to see if you have it. 
Symptoms of Brugada syndrome
 Symptoms of Brugada syndromeMany people with Brugada syndrome do not have any symptoms and do not realise they have it.Some people experience:blackoutsfits (seizures)occasional noticeable heartbeats (palpitations), chest pain, breathlessness, or dizzinessYou can get symptoms at any time, but they are sometimes triggered by something such as a high temperature, drinking lots of alcohol, or dehydration.Symptoms often first appear during adulthood, but they can happen at any age. They're more common in men than women or children. 
When to get medical advice
 When to get medical adviceSee a GP if:you have unexplained blackouts or seizuresone of your parents, siblings or children has been diagnosed with Brugada syndrome – this may mean you're also at riska close family member has died suddenly with no explanation – it can sometimes be the result of an undiagnosed heart problem like Brugada syndromeYou may be referred to a heart specialist for some simple tests to check if you have Brugada syndrome or any other heart problem.If you've already been diagnosed with Brugada syndrome, contact your specialist as soon as possible if you experience any symptoms. 
Tests for Brugada syndrome
 Tests for Brugada syndromeThe main test for Brugada syndrome is as an electrocardiogram (ECG). It checks the heart's electrical activity and is usually done in hospital.During an ECG, small sensors are attached to your arms, legs and chest. They're connected to a machine that measures the electrical signals produced by your heart each time it beats.A medicine called ajmaline or flecainide may be given into a vein during the test to see how it affects your heart. This can help show up the unusual heartbeats caused by Brugada syndrome.You may also have a blood test to look for one of the faulty genes that causes Brugada syndrome.Read about genetic testing. 
Treatments for Brugada syndrome
 Treatments for Brugada syndromeThere's currently no cure for Brugada syndrome, but there are things you can do to reduce your risk of experiencing serious problems.If your doctor thinks your risk of developing a dangerously fast heartbeat is low, you might not need any treatment at first.Avoid triggersYou can reduce your risk of developing a fast heartbeat by avoiding things that can trigger it, including:a high temperature – if you develop a high temperature, take painkillers such as paracetamol to bring it down; get medical advice as soon as possible if this does not helpdrinking too much alcohol – avoid drinking lots of alcohol in a short space of timedehydration – get medical advice if you have diarrhoea or you keep being sick, as you may lose a lot of fluid and may need to take special rehydration drinkscertain medicines – make sure any healthcare professional you see knows you have Brugada syndrome, and avoid medicines that can trigger the condition unless they're recommended by a doctor – the BrugadaDrugs.org website has more information about medicines that could act as possible triggersAsk your specialist about other things you may need to avoid or look out for.Implanted defibrillatorIf there's a high risk you could develop a dangerously fast heartbeat, your specialist may recommend having an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) fitted.An ICD is a small device placed in the chest, similar to a pacemaker. If it senses your heart is beating at a dangerous speed, it sends out an electric shock to help it return to normal.An ICD does not prevent a fast heartbeat, but can help stop it becoming life threatening.Read more about out how an ICD is fitted. 
Living with Brugada syndrome

But the chances of this happening can be significantly reduced if it's diagnosed and treated.You'll need to avoid things that can trigger the condition and have regular check-ups.

Support and advice
 Support and adviceLiving with a serious long-term condition like Brugada syndrome can be difficult.Your specialist can give you support if you need it, but you might also find it helpful to contact a charity or support group for people with Brugada syndrome or similar heart conditions.Some of the main groups are:Arrhythmia AllianceBritish Heart FoundationCardiac Risk in the YoungSADS UKThere's also a HealthUnlocked forum for people with arrhythmias, where you can discuss your condition with other people in a similar situation. 
Information about you
 Information about youIf you have Brugada syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.
