 Breast reduction surgery can help women who are unhappy with the shape, weight or droop of their breasts by making them smaller and more lifted.But if it's done to improve appearance rather than for health reasons, it's not normally available on the NHS. Instead, you'll need to pay for the procedure privately.Information about breast reduction for cosmetic reasons is provided elsewhere.Read about cosmetic breast reduction for women and male breast reduction.This page focuses on when breast reduction might be available on the NHS. 
Eligibility criteria for NHS breast reduction
 Eligibility criteria for NHS breast reductionThe availability of breast reduction surgery on the NHS varies, depending on the eligibility criteria decided by your local integrated care board (ICB).Some ICBs do not fund breast reduction surgery at all, and others fund it selectively if you fulfil certain criteria.Generally speaking, you might be considered for breast reduction on the NHS if you have problems caused by having very large breasts, such as:backacheshoulder or neck painskin irritationrashes and skin infections under the breastsgrooves on the shoulders from bra strapspsychological distress, such as low self-esteem or depressionan inability to exercise or take part in sportsICBs also tend to have additional criteria that may include the size of your breasts, your weight, your age, whether you smoke, and whether other options (such as wearing professionally fitted bras) have been tried, but have not helped.You can find out what the eligibility criteria are in your area from a GP or by contacting your local ICB. 
The referral process
 The referral processSee a GP if you think you might be eligible for breast reduction surgery on the NHS.They can check whether you meet the criteria of your local ICB and, if you do, they can refer you to a breast or plastic surgeon for an assessment.This may involve:asking about the problems you're havingchecking your weight and general healthan assessment by a psychiatrist or psychologistinformation about the risks and results of surgeryThe assessment will help determine whether you're suitable for surgery and whether there's a strong enough reason for this to be done on the NHS.The final decision is usually made by a panel of representatives from your local ICB, which will take into account the information from your assessments and a review of your individual case.
