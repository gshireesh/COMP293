 Herbal medicines are those with active ingredients made from plant parts, such as leaves, roots or flowers. But being "natural" doesn't necessarily mean they're safe for you to take.Just like conventional medicines, herbal medicines will have an effect on the body, and can be potentially harmful if not used correctly.They should therefore be used with the same care and respect as conventional medicines.If you're consulting your doctor or pharmacist about health matters, or are about to undergo surgery, always tell them about any herbal medicines you're taking.
