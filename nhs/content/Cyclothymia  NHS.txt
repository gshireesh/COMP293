 Cyclothymia, or cyclothymic disorder, causes mood changes – from feeling low to emotional highs.Cyclothymia has many similarities to bipolar disorder.Most people's symptoms are mild enough that they do not seek mental health treatment, or the emotional highs feel nice, so they do not realise there's anything wrong or want to seek help.This means cyclothymia often goes undiagnosed and untreated.But the mood swings can affect daily life, and cause problems with personal and work relationships.If you think you have cyclothymia, it's important to seek help from a GP.People with cyclothymia are at risk of developing bipolar disorder, so it's important to get help before reaching this stage.Men and women of any age can get cyclothymia, but it's more common in women. 
Symptoms of cyclothymia
 Symptoms of cyclothymiaIf you have cyclothymia, you'll have periods of feeling low followed by periods of extreme happiness and excitement (called hypomania) when you do not need much sleep and feel that you have a lot of energy.The periods of low mood do not last long enough and are not severe enough to be diagnosed as clinical depression.You might feel sluggish and lose interest in things during these periods, but this should not stop you going about your day-to-day life.Mood swings will be fairly frequent – you will not go for longer than 2 months without experiencing low mood or an emotional high.Symptoms of cyclothymia are not severe enough for you to be diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and your mood swings will be broken up by periods of normal mood.
