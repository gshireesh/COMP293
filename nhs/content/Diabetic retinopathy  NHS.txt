 Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes, caused by high blood sugar levels damaging the back of the eye (retina). It can cause blindness if left undiagnosed and untreated.However, it usually takes several years for diabetic retinopathy to reach a stage where it could threaten your sight.To minimise the risk of this happening, people with diabetes should:ensure they control their blood sugar levels, blood pressure and cholesterolattend diabetic eye screening appointments – screening is offered to all people with diabetes aged 12 and over to pick up and treat any problems early on 
How diabetes can affect the eyes
 How diabetes can affect the eyesThe retina is the light-sensitive layer of cells at the back of the eye that converts light into electrical signals. The signals are sent to the brain which turns them into the images you see.The retina needs a constant supply of blood, which it receives through a network of tiny blood vessels.Over time, a persistently high blood sugar level can damage these blood vessels in 3 main stages:background retinopathy – tiny bulges develop in the blood vessels, which may bleed slightly but do not usually affect your visionpre-proliferative retinopathy – more severe and widespread changes affect the blood vessels, including more significant bleeding into the eyeproliferative retinopathy – scar tissue and new blood vessels, which are weak and bleed easily, develop on the retina; this can result in some loss of visionHowever, if a problem with your eyes is picked up early, lifestyle changes and treatment can stop it getting worse.Read about the stages of diabetic retinopathy.
