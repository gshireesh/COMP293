Causes of Paget's disease of bone
 Causes of Paget's disease of bone Bone cells regenerate in a similar way to skin – old bone is removed and replaced by new bone. This is known as bone remodelling.2 cells are responsible for this:osteoclasts – cells that absorb old boneosteoblasts – cells that make new boneIn Paget's disease of bone, something goes wrong with the osteoclast cells and they start to absorb bone at a much faster rate than usual.The osteoblasts then try to produce new bone more quickly, but the new bone is larger and weaker than normal.It's not clear what triggers this, but you're at a higher risk if you have a family history of Paget's disease of bone. You may inherit a genetic fault that means you're much more likely to develop the condition.
