Why some people are sensitive to hair dye
 Why some people are sensitive to hair dyeSome people are prone to a skin reaction called contact dermatitis.This means their skin may become red, dry, scaly, bumpy, blistered, or irritated (inflamed) when they come into contact with a particular substance.The substance may either be an irritant, directly damaging the skin, or an allergen, triggering an allergic reaction that affects the skin.Many permanent and some semi-permanent hair dyes contain a chemical called paraphenylenediamine (PPD), which is a known irritant and allergen.Darker coloured dyes contain higher level of PPD.PPD is the cause of most reactions to hair dye.Is PPD safe?Hair dyes containing PPD are safe to use, providing safety instructions are followed. These products are strictly regulated and there's a maximum limit to the amount of PPD the product can contain.If you ignore the safety instructions that come with the dye, you could put yourself at risk of a serious reaction.You're particularly at risk if you have (or have previously had) a black henna tattoo.These temporary tattoos should be avoided because the paste often contains high levels of PPD, which can increase the risk of an allergic reaction the next time you're exposed to it. So, you could develop a life-threatening allergic reaction when you next use PPD hair dye.Learn more about the dangers of black henna tattoos.
