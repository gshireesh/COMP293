 Infertility is when a couple cannot get pregnant (conceive) despite having regular unprotected sex.Around 1 in 7 couples may have difficulty conceiving.More than 8 out of 10 couples, where the woman is under 40, will conceive naturally within a year if they have regular unprotected sex (every 2 or 3 days).For couples who have been trying to conceive for more than 3 years without success, the likelihood of getting pregnant naturally within the next year is 1 in 4, or less. 
Getting help
 Getting help Some people get pregnant quickly, but for others it can take longer. It's a good idea to see a GP if you have not conceived after a year of trying.Women aged 36 and over, and anyone who's already aware they may have fertility problems, should see their GP sooner.They can check for common causes of fertility problems and suggest treatments that could help.Infertility is usually only diagnosed when a couple have not managed to conceive after a year of trying.There are 2 types of infertility:primary infertility – where someone who's never conceived a child in the past has difficulty conceivingsecondary infertility – where someone has had 1 or more pregnancies in the past, but is having difficulty conceiving againRead more about how infertility is diagnosed. 
Treating infertility
 Treating infertility Fertility treatments include:medical treatment for lack of regular ovulationsurgical procedures such as treatment for endometriosis, repair of the fallopian tubes, or removal of scarring (adhesions) within the womb or abdominal cavityassisted conception such as intrauterine insemination (IUI) or IVFThe treatment offered will depend on what's causing the fertility problems and what's available from your local integrated care board (ICB).Private treatment is also available, but it can be expensive and there's no guarantee it will be successful.It's important to choose a private clinic carefully. You can ask a GP for advice, and should make sure you choose a clinic that's licensed by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA).Some treatments for infertility, such as IVF, can cause complications.For example:multiple pregnancy – if more than 1 embryo is placed in the womb as part of IVF treatment there's an increased chance of having twins; this may not seem like a bad thing, but it significantly increases the risk of complications for you and your babiesectopic pregnancy – the risk of having an ectopic pregnancy is slightly increased if you have IVFRead more about how infertility is treated.
