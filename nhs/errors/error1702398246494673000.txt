        "a": "CPR can sometimes get the heart and breathing going again. The actions used in CPR, such as chest compressions, can cause bruising, break ribs and puncture lungs. Overall, CPR restarts the heart and/or breathing for between 1 and 2 in 10 people whose heart or breathing have stopped. The chances of CPR starting your heart and/or breathing are lower if your organs are struggling to work before CPR is needed."

        "i": "<noinput>",
        "a": "A DNACPR decision can be made by you in advance to refuse CPR or by your doctor even if you do not agree. The decision is usually made based on your health, needs, and priorities as an individual. If you lack capacity to decide about CPR, the decision is made by the senior doctor after consultation with the people important to you or an independent mental capacity advocate (IMCA)."

        "a": "A DNACPR form can be written for a short period, like during a hospital admission, or with no end date, such as in cases of long-term conditions. It is recommended that a DNACPR is reviewed each time your situation changes, and the review date is usually recorded on the form."

If you are not the patient and the patient has capacity, they will need to agree to it being discussed with you. If you do not have capacity, your family, friends, or those with legal power can raise concerns on your behalf. If you are still not satisfied, you can follow the complaints procedure of the practice or hospital or contact NHS England and NHS Improvement."

If you do not have these documents, a best interest's decision will be made by the senior doctor, involving your family, friends, or an independent mental capacity advocate (IMCA) if necessary."
