        "a": "A DNACPR decision can be made by the patient themselves, by their doctor, or by both. The decision is typically made when the patient has capacity to do so, but in some cases, the doctor can make the decision even if the patient does not agree. The decision is usually recorded on a special form and involves consultation with the patient, their doctor, and other healthcare professionals."

The doctor will consult with important people in the person's life, such as family members or legal representatives, to make the decision.

If you are not the patient and the patient has capacity, they need to agree to discuss it with you. If the patient lacks capacity, their family, friends, or legal representatives can raise concerns on their behalf. Complaints can be made following the appropriate procedures."
