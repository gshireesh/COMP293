0,How can genes influence the risk of cancer?,<noinput>,"Genes can influence the risk of cancer by carrying faulty versions or variants that can't repair damaged cells, leading to the formation of tumors."
1,What is predictive genetic testing for cancer?,<noinput>,"Predictive genetic testing for cancer is a type of genetic test that can determine if you have inherited a cancer risk gene, which greatly increases your risk of developing cancer."
2,How long does it take to get the results of a predictive genetic test?,<noinput>,The results of a predictive genetic test usually take 2 to 4 weeks to come through after a blood sample is taken.
3,What are the advantages of having a predictive genetic test?,<noinput>,"The advantages of having a predictive genetic test include being able to take steps to manage your risk of developing cancer, making lifestyle changes, having regular screenings, and adopting preventative treatments."
4,What are the disadvantages of having a predictive genetic test?,<noinput>,"The disadvantages of having a predictive genetic test include inconclusive results, permanent anxiety from a positive result, and not wanting to know the risk unless actually diagnosed with cancer."
5,What are the options to manage the risk of cancer?,<noinput>,"Options to manage the risk of cancer include regularly examining your breasts, undergoing screenings like mammograms and MRI scans, making lifestyle changes, taking medicines like tamoxifen, raloxifene, and anastrozole, and considering risk-reducing surgery."
6,Is genetic testing for cancer available on the NHS?,<noinput>,Genetic testing for cancer is available on the NHS if the faulty gene has already been identified in a relative or if there is a strong family history of cancer.
7,What are the chances of passing on a faulty cancer risk gene to your children?,<noinput>,"If you have a faulty cancer risk gene, there is a 50% chance you will pass it on to your children."
8,What are the options for planning a family if the predictive genetic test is positive?,<noinput>,"If the predictive genetic test is positive and you want to start a family, the options include having children without intervention, adoption, using donor eggs or sperm, prenatal testing, and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis."
9,Is genetic testing for cancer available privately?,<noinput>,"Genetic testing for cancer is available privately if you are not eligible for the NHS test, but it can be expensive and there's no guarantee of predicting future cancer risks."
0,What are some types of cancer that can run in families?,<noinput>,"Some types of cancer that can run in families are breast, ovarian, colorectal, and prostate cancer."
1,How can genes influence the risk of developing cancer?,<noinput>,"Genes can influence the risk of developing cancer by carrying certain genes that protect against cancer, and inheriting faulty versions of these genes can raise the risk."
2,What is predictive genetic testing and how can it help with identifying cancer risk genes?,<noinput>,Predictive genetic testing is a type of testing that can identify if someone has inherited a cancer risk gene. It can help determine if someone has an increased risk of developing cancer.
3,What are the pros and cons of having a predictive genetic test for cancer risk?,<noinput>,"The pros of having a predictive genetic test include being able to manage the risk of developing cancer, making lifestyle changes, and reducing stress. The cons include inconclusive results and potential anxiety."
4,What are the steps involved in genetic testing for cancer risk?,<noinput>,"The steps involved in genetic testing for cancer risk usually include a diagnostic blood test for a relative with cancer, and if their test is positive, a predictive genetic test can be done for other family members."
5,What does a positive result in a predictive genetic test mean for cancer risk?,<noinput>,"A positive result in a predictive genetic test means that the individual has a faulty gene that increases their risk of developing cancer, but it does not guarantee that they will develop cancer."
6,What are the options for managing cancer risk if the test result is positive?,<noinput>,"The options for managing cancer risk include regular screenings, lifestyle changes, medicine (chemoprevention), and risk-reducing surgery."
7,How can close relatives be informed about the results of a genetic test?,<noinput>,"Close relatives can be informed about the results of a genetic test by the individual who had the test, and they can also be provided with a standard letter explaining the results."
8,What are the options for planning a family if there is a positive result in a predictive genetic test?,<noinput>,"The options for planning a family include having children without intervention, adoption, using donor eggs or sperm, discussing prenatal testing, or considering pre-implantation genetic diagnosis."
9,What should be considered when considering private testing for cancer risk?,<noinput>,"When considering private testing for cancer risk, it's important to consider the likelihood of having a faulty gene, the cost of the test, the limitations of the test, and the availability of genetic counseling."
