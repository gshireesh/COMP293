0,What is Patau's syndrome?,<noinput>,"Patau's syndrome is a rare genetic disorder caused by having an additional copy of chromosome 13 in some or all of the body's cells. It severely disrupts normal development and can result in serious health problems, often leading to miscarriage, stillbirth, or the baby dying shortly after birth."
1,What are the symptoms and features of Patau's syndrome?,<noinput>,"Babies with Patau's syndrome can have restricted growth in the womb, resulting in a low birth weight. They may also have severe heart defects, brain abnormalities, facial and head abnormalities, as well as other issues such as abdominal wall defects and kidney abnormalities."
2,What causes Patau's syndrome?,<noinput>,"Patau's syndrome happens by chance and is not caused by anything the parents have done. It occurs due to an error during conception, resulting in an additional copy or part of a copy of chromosome 13. It can also arise from chromosomal translocations or mosaicism."
3,How is Patau's syndrome screened for?,<noinput>,"Patau's syndrome can be screened for using the combined test, which involves a blood test and an ultrasound scan, typically performed between 10 to 14 weeks of pregnancy. If a higher chance is detected, non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) may be offered, followed by diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling."
4,Is there any treatment for Patau's syndrome?,<noinput>,There is no specific treatment for Patau's syndrome. Doctors focus on minimizing discomfort and ensuring the baby is able to feed. Care for babies with Patau's syndrome depends on their specific symptoms and needs.
5,Do both parents need genetic testing if their baby is affected by Patau's syndrome?,<noinput>,Both parents may need to have their chromosomes analyzed if their baby is affected by Patau's syndrome caused by a chromosomal translocation. Genetic testing helps in planning for future pregnancies and assessing the likelihood of the syndrome affecting future pregnancies.
6,What happens if a child has Patau's syndrome?,<noinput>,Information about a child with Patau's syndrome is passed on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS). This allows scientists to gather data to better understand and treat the condition.
7,Where can I find further information and support about Patau's syndrome?,<noinput>,"Organizations such as Genetic Alliance UK and Support Organisation for Trisomy 13/18 (SOFT UK) can provide further information, advice, and support regarding Patau's syndrome."
8,What are some common health problems associated with Patau's syndrome?,<noinput>,"Babies with Patau's syndrome can have severe heart defects, brain abnormalities, facial and head abnormalities, abdominal wall defects, and kidney abnormalities. They may also have hand and foot abnormalities, such as extra fingers or toes."
9,Does Patau's syndrome have a high mortality rate?,<noinput>,"Yes, more than 9 out of 10 children born with Patau's syndrome die during the first year. Patau's syndrome often results in miscarriage, stillbirth, or the baby dying shortly after birth."
10,How common is Patau's syndrome?,<noinput>,"Patau's syndrome affects about 1 in every 4,000 births. The risk of having a baby with Patau's syndrome increases with the mother's age."
0,What is Patau's syndrome?,<noinput>,"Patau's syndrome is a rare genetic disorder caused by having an additional copy of chromosome 13 in some or all of the body's cells, resulting in severe health problems and often leading to miscarriage, stillbirth, or death shortly after birth."
1,What are the symptoms and features of Patau's syndrome?,<noinput>,"Babies with Patau's syndrome can have restricted growth in the womb, low birth weight, severe heart defects, brain abnormalities, facial and head abnormalities, abdominal wall defects, kidney abnormalities, and abnormalities of the hands and feet."
2,What causes Patau's syndrome?,<noinput>,"Patau's syndrome occurs randomly during conception when there is an error in cell division, resulting in an additional copy of chromosome 13. It is not caused by anything the parents have done."
3,How is Patau's syndrome diagnosed?,<noinput>,"Screening tests, such as the combined test at 10 to 14 weeks of pregnancy, and non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), can assess the likelihood of having a baby with Patau's syndrome. Diagnostic tests, such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling, can be done to confirm the presence of the extra copy of chromosome 13."
4,Is there a specific treatment for Patau's syndrome?,<noinput>,There is no specific treatment for Patau's syndrome. Healthcare providers focus on minimizing discomfort and ensuring the baby is able to feed. Care for babies with Patau's syndrome who survive beyond the first few days depends on their specific symptoms and needs.
5,What genetic testing is recommended for parents of a baby with Patau's syndrome?,<noinput>,Both parents should have their chromosomes analyzed if their baby is affected by Patau's syndrome caused by a chromosomal translocation. Genetic testing helps parents plan for future pregnancies and assess the likelihood of the syndrome affecting future pregnancies.
6,Where can I find further information and support for Patau's syndrome?,<noinput>,"Organizations such as Genetic Alliance UK and Support Organisation for Trisomy 13/18 (SOFT UK) can provide further information, advice, and support for Patau's syndrome."
7,What is the combined test for Patau's syndrome?,<noinput>,"The combined test is a screening test offered at 10 to 14 weeks of pregnancy. It involves a blood test and an ultrasound scan to assess the chances of having a baby with Patau's syndrome, Down's syndrome, or Edwards' syndrome."
8,What is non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for Patau's syndrome?,<noinput>,Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is a blood test that provides a more accurate screening result for Patau's syndrome. It helps parents decide whether to have a diagnostic test and is available for free on the NHS.
9,What is the treatment and care for babies with Patau's syndrome who survive beyond the first few days?,<noinput>,The treatment and care for babies with Patau's syndrome who survive depend on their specific symptoms and needs. Healthcare providers focus on minimizing discomfort and ensuring the baby is able to feed.
