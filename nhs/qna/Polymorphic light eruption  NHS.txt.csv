1,How is polymorphic light eruption different from prickly heat?,<noinput>,"Polymorphic light eruption is triggered by sunlight or UV light, while prickly heat is caused by warm weather or overheating. The skin in polymorphic light eruption can 'harden' or desensitize after repeated sun exposure, while prickly heat does not."
2,Who is more likely to be affected by polymorphic light eruption?,<noinput>,"Polymorphic light eruption is more common in women than men and usually affects people with white skin. However, it can also occur in those with brown and black skin. It typically starts between the ages of 20 and 40."
3,What causes polymorphic light eruption?,<noinput>,"Polymorphic light eruption is thought to be caused by UV light altering a substance in the skin, leading to an immune system reaction and inflammation. It is not a hereditary condition and is not contagious."
4,Are there any treatments for polymorphic light eruption?,<noinput>,"There is no cure for polymorphic light eruption, but treatments can help manage the rash. These include avoiding the sun, using sunscreen with SPF 50 or above, and applying corticosteroid cream or ointment when the rash appears. Desensitization or UV treatment may also be recommended."
5,How can sunscreen help prevent polymorphic light eruption?,<noinput>,"Sunscreen with SPF 50 or above and a UVA rating of 4 or 5 stars can help prevent the development of polymorphic light eruption. It should be applied thickly and evenly 15 to 30 minutes before sun exposure, reapplied every 2 hours, and after swimming."
6,What is desensitization or UV treatment for polymorphic light eruption?,<noinput>,Desensitization or UV treatment involves visiting a hospital dermatology department 3 times a week for 4 to 6 weeks in the spring. The skin is gradually exposed to increasing amounts of UV light to build up resistance to sunlight. This process needs to be repeated each spring.
7,What is hardening or toughening for polymorphic light eruption?,<noinput>,Hardening or toughening involves gradually increasing the resistance of the skin to sunlight by spending short periods of time outside in the spring. This can be done at home under the guidance of a GP or dermatologist. The effects of hardening are lost in the winter and need to be built up again in the spring.
8,Can polymorphic light eruption cause vitamin D deficiency?,<noinput>,People with polymorphic light eruption are at a greater risk of vitamin D deficiency as sunlight exposure is needed to produce vitamin D. A GP can advise whether vitamin D supplements are necessary.
9,What is the outlook for people with polymorphic light eruption?,<noinput>,"Many people with polymorphic light eruption experience improvement over the years. Their skin may become more resistant to sunlight during the summer, allowing for better tolerance.

0,What are the symptoms of polymorphic light eruption?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of polymorphic light eruption include an itchy or burning rash that appears within hours or up to 2 to 3 days after sun exposure. The rash lasts for up to 2 weeks and usually appears on the head, neck, chest, and arms."
1,How does polymorphic light eruption differ from prickly heat?,<noinput>,"Polymorphic light eruption is triggered by sunlight or UV light, while prickly heat is caused by warm weather or overheating. The skin in polymorphic light eruption may harden or desensitize, whereas this doesn't happen in prickly heat."
2,What factors contribute to the development of polymorphic light eruption?,<noinput>,"Polymorphic light eruption is thought to be caused by UV light altering substances in the skin, which triggers an immune reaction and inflammation. It is more common in women, people with white skin, and usually starts between the ages of 20 and 40."
3,Is polymorphic light eruption a hereditary condition?,<noinput>,"Polymorphic light eruption is not passed down through families, but about 1 in 5 people with the condition have an affected relative. It is believed to be a fairly common condition affecting 10% to 15% of the UK population."
4,What are the treatment options for polymorphic light eruption?,<noinput>,"There is no cure for polymorphic light eruption, but management options include avoiding the sun, wearing protective clothing, using sunscreen with SPF 50 or above, and applying corticosteroid creams when the rash appears. Desensitization or UV treatment can also be considered."
5,How can I prevent polymorphic light eruption?,<noinput>,"To prevent polymorphic light eruption, avoid sun exposure between 11am and 3pm when the sun's rays are strongest. Wear protective clothing and apply sunscreen with SPF 50 or above. Gradual exposure to sunlight in the spring and hardening of the skin may also help."
6,Can polymorphic light eruption lead to vitamin D deficiency?,<noinput>,People with polymorphic light eruption are at risk of vitamin D deficiency because they may avoid sun exposure. A doctor can advise whether vitamin D supplements are necessary.
7,What is the outlook for polymorphic light eruption?,<noinput>,"Many people with polymorphic light eruption find that their skin improves over time. Some may experience hardening of the skin during the summer, which makes them less reactive to sunlight. However, for others, it may be a long-term condition that requires management."
8,What are the various forms of rash seen in polymorphic light eruption?,<noinput>,"The rash in polymorphic light eruption can appear as raised, pink or red spots, blisters that turn into dry patches, or even a target-like pattern. However, redness may be harder to see on brown and black skin."
9,How soon after sun exposure does the rash in polymorphic light eruption typically appear?,<noinput>,"The rash in polymorphic light eruption can appear within a few hours, or up to 2 to 3 days after exposure to sunlight. It then lasts for up to 2 weeks before healing without scarring."
