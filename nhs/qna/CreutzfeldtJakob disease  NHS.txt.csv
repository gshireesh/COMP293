0,What are the symptoms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease include loss of intellect and memory, changes in personality, loss of balance and coordination, slurred speech, vision problems and blindness, abnormal jerking movements, and progressive loss of brain function and mobility."
1,What causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?,<noinput>,"Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is caused by an abnormal infectious protein called a prion, which accumulates at high levels in the brain and causes irreversible damage to nerve cells."
2,What are the types of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?,<noinput>,"There are four main types of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: sporadic CJD, variant CJD, familial or inherited CJD, and iatrogenic CJD."
3,What is sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?,<noinput>,"Sporadic CJD is the most common type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Its precise cause is unclear, but it is believed to involve a normal brain protein changing abnormally and turning into a prion. It mainly affects adults aged between 45 and 75."
4,What is variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?,<noinput>,"Variant CJD is likely to be caused by consuming meat from a cow that had bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also known as 'mad cow' disease. Strict controls have been effective in preventing infected meat from entering the food chain."
5,What is familial or inherited Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?,<noinput>,Familial CJD is a very rare genetic condition caused by a mutation in the prion protein gene inherited from a parent. It affects about 1 in every 9 million people in the UK and usually develops in early 50s.
6,What is iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?,<noinput>,Iatrogenic CJD is when the infection is accidentally spread through medical or surgical treatment. It can occur if instruments used during brain surgery on a person with CJD aren't properly cleaned between each surgical procedure and are reused on another person.
7,How is Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease treated?,<noinput>,There is currently no cure for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and making the affected person as comfortable as possible.
8,Is there a compensation scheme for variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?,<noinput>,"Yes, there is a compensation scheme for UK victims of variant CJD. The vCJD Trust assesses claims and provides compensation to victims and their families."

3,What is sporadic CJD?,<noinput>,"Sporadic CJD is the most common type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and its precise cause is unknown. It typically affects adults aged between 45 and 75."
4,How is variant CJD transmitted?,<noinput>,"Variant CJD is likely caused by consuming meat from cows with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also known as 'mad cow' disease. It can also be transmitted through contaminated blood transfusions."
5,What is familial or inherited CJD?,<noinput>,"Familial or inherited CJD is a rare genetic condition where an inherited gene mutation causes prions to form in the brain, leading to CJD symptoms."
6,How is CJD treated?,<noinput>,"There is currently no cure for CJD. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms, such as using medication for anxiety, depression, and pain management, and providing nursing care and assistance with feeding."
7,Is there a compensation scheme for variant CJD victims in the UK?,<noinput>,"Yes, there is a compensation scheme called the vCJD Trust, which assesses claims and provides compensation to UK victims and their families."
8,How many deaths were recorded from sporadic CJD in the UK in 2020?,<noinput>,There were 131 recorded deaths from sporadic CJD in the UK in 2020.
9,How many deaths were recorded from variant CJD in the UK in 2020?,<noinput>,There were no recorded deaths from variant CJD in the UK in 2020.
0,What are the symptoms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of CJD include loss of intellect and memory, changes in personality, loss of balance and coordination, slurred speech, vision problems and blindness, abnormal jerking movements, progressive loss of brain function and mobility. Most people with CJD will die within a year of the symptoms starting, usually from infection."
1,What causes CJD?,<noinput>,"CJD appears to be caused by an abnormal infectious protein called a prion. These prions accumulate at high levels in the brain and cause irreversible damage to nerve cells. While the abnormal prions are technically infectious, they're very different from viruses and bacteria."
2,What are the different types of CJD?,<noinput>,"There are 4 main types of CJD: sporadic CJD, variant CJD, familial or inherited CJD, and iatrogenic CJD."
3,What is sporadic CJD?,<noinput>,"Sporadic CJD is the most common type of CJD. It occurs in adults aged between 45 and 75 and its cause is still unclear. Most cases of sporadic CJD occur in adults aged between 45 and 75. It is very rare, affecting only 1 or 2 people in every million each year in the UK."
4,What is variant CJD?,<noinput>,"Variant CJD (vCJD) is likely to be caused by consuming meat from a cow that had bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or 'mad cow' disease), a similar prion disease to CJD. The link between variant CJD and BSE was discovered in 1996, and strict controls have prevented infected meat from entering the food chain."
5,How is familial or inherited CJD different?,<noinput>,Familial or inherited CJD is a very rare genetic condition where a person inherits a gene mutation that causes prions to form in their brain during adulthood. It affects about 1 in every 9 million people in the UK.
6,How can iatrogenic CJD occur?,<noinput>,"Iatrogenic CJD occurs when the infection is accidentally spread from someone with CJD through medical or surgical treatment. For example, it can happen if instruments used during brain surgery on a person with CJD aren't properly cleaned and are reused on another person."
7,Is there a cure for CJD?,<noinput>,"There is currently no cure for CJD. Treatment aims to relieve symptoms and make the affected person feel as comfortable as possible, such as using medicine for anxiety, depression, and pain relief."
8,What is the variant CJD compensation scheme?,<noinput>,The variant CJD compensation scheme was announced in October 2001. The vCJD Trust assesses claims and pays compensation to UK victims of variant CJD and their families.
9,How is CJD treated?,<noinput>,"There is no cure for CJD, so treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and providing supportive care. This can include the use of medication for anxiety, depression, and pain relief, as well as nursing care and assistance with feeding for some individuals."
