0,What happens in MDS?,<noinput>,"In MDS, the bone marrow doesn't make enough healthy blood cells. Instead, it produces abnormal cells that are not fully developed. These abnormal cells replace the healthy ones, leading to a decrease in the number of functional blood cells in the bloodstream. In some cases, MDS can progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML)."
1,What are the main types of MDS?,<noinput>,"The main types of MDS are MDS with single lineage dysplasia, MDS with multilineage dysplasia, and MDS with excess blasts. These terms replaced the previous classification of refractory anaemia, refractory cytopenia, and refractory anaemia with excess blasts, respectively."
2,What are the symptoms of MDS?,<noinput>,"The symptoms of MDS can include weakness, tiredness, breathlessness (due to low red blood cells), frequent infections (due to low white blood cells), and bruising/easy bleeding (due to low platelets). Some people with MDS may not have any symptoms and may only discover their condition through blood tests."
3,What is the risk of MDS developing into leukemia?,<noinput>,Some people with MDS may develop acute myeloid leukemia (AML) over time. The risk of this transformation depends on the type of MDS and the balance between normal and abnormal blood cells in the body. It is important to discuss your individual risk with your doctor.
4,What are the treatments for MDS?,<noinput>,"The treatment for MDS depends on the type of MDS, risk of developing AML, and other health conditions. Treatment aims to restore normal blood cell counts and manage symptoms. Options include growth factor medicines, blood transfusions, iron removal, antibiotics, lenalidomide, azacitidine, chemotherapy, immunosuppressants, and stem cell transplant."
5,What are the causes of MDS?,<noinput>,"The cause of MDS is often unknown (primary MDS), but in rare cases, it can be caused by chemotherapy (secondary MDS or treatment-related MDS). MDS usually does not run in families, although there are rare types that may have a genetic component."
6,How is MDS diagnosed?,<noinput>,MDS is diagnosed through blood tests to assess blood cell counts and bone marrow tests. A bone marrow test involves taking a sample of bone marrow from the hip bone using a needle. The sample is then examined under a microscope to determine the presence of abnormal cells.
7,What support is available for people with MDS?,<noinput>,"There are several organizations that offer support and information to individuals diagnosed with MDS, including MDS UK Patient Support Group, MDS Foundation, Blood Cancer UK, Leukaemia Care, Macmillan Cancer Support, and Cancer Research UK."
8,Are there any clinical trials for MDS?,<noinput>,"Yes, there are ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of MDS. Participating in a clinical trial may offer the opportunity to access new treatments and contribute to medical research. You can find more information about clinical trials for MDS on the 'Be Part of Research' website."

0,What happens in MDS?,<noinput>,"In MDS, the bone marrow doesn't make enough healthy blood cells. Instead, it produces abnormal cells that are immature. These abnormal cells take over the bone marrow, squeezing out the healthy ones and leading to a decrease in the number of cells in the bloodstream."
1,What are the main types of MDS?,<noinput>,"The main types of MDS are MDS with single lineage dysplasia, MDS with multilineage dysplasia, and MDS with excess blasts. These types are based on the types of blood cells affected by MDS."
2,What are the symptoms of MDS?,<noinput>,"The symptoms of MDS can include weakness, tiredness, breathlessness, frequent infections, bruising, and easy bleeding. However, some people with MDS may not experience any symptoms and may only discover it through blood tests."
3,What is the risk of MDS developing into leukemia?,<noinput>,"Some people with MDS may develop acute myeloid leukemia (AML), also known as transformation. The risk of this happening varies depending on the type of MDS and the balance of normal and abnormal blood cells in the body."
4,What are the treatments for MDS?,<noinput>,"The treatments for MDS depend on the type of MDS, the risk of developing AML, and other health conditions. Treatment aims to normalize blood cell counts and manage symptoms. Options include growth factor medicines, blood transfusions, iron chelation therapy, antibiotics, lenalidomide, azacitidine, chemotherapy, immunosuppressants, and stem cell transplant."
5,What are the causes of MDS?,<noinput>,"The cause of MDS is often unknown, referred to as primary MDS. In some cases, MDS can be caused by chemotherapy, known as secondary MDS or treatment-related MDS. Although MDS doesn't usually run in families, rare types of MDS can have a genetic component."
6,How is MDS diagnosed?,<noinput>,MDS is diagnosed through blood tests and bone marrow tests. Blood tests determine the levels of normal and abnormal blood cells. A bone marrow test involves taking a sample from the hip bone and examining it under a microscope.
7,Where can I find further support for MDS?,<noinput>,"There are several organizations that offer support and information to people diagnosed with MDS, including MDS UK Patient Support Group, MDS Foundation, Blood Cancer UK, Leukaemia Care, Macmillan Cancer Support, and Cancer Research UK."
8,Are there any clinical trials for MDS?,<noinput>,"Yes, there are clinical trials for MDS. It is an evolving field with new medicines being tested. You may have the opportunity to participate in a clinical trial, and you can learn more about them at Be Part of Research."
9,Can you answer some questions about your visit today?,<noinput>,"I'm sorry, I can't answer that question as I am an AI language model. However, I'm here to help you with any questions you may have about MDS."
