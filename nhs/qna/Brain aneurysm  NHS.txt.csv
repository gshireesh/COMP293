8,Can brain aneurysms be hereditary?,<noinput>,"There is a familial risk associated with brain aneurysms, meaning that having a family history of aneurysms increases the risk of developing one. However, not all brain aneurysms are hereditary."
9,What are the long-term effects of a ruptured brain aneurysm?,<noinput>,"The long-term effects of a ruptured brain aneurysm can vary depending on the extent and location of the bleeding. They can include cognitive, neurological, and emotional changes, as well as physical disabilities."
