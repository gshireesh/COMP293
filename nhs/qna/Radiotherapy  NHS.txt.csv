0,What are the different types of radiotherapy?,<noinput>,"The different types of radiotherapy include external radiotherapy, radiotherapy implants (brachytherapy), radiotherapy injections or capsules (radioisotope therapy), and intrabeam radiotherapy."
1,What are the side effects of radiotherapy?,<noinput>,"Common side effects of radiotherapy include sore skin, fatigue, hair loss, nausea, loss of appetite, sore mouth, and diarrhea. These side effects can usually be treated or prevented."
2,When is radiotherapy used?,<noinput>,"Radiotherapy can be used in the early stages of cancer, after it has spread, to try to cure the cancer, make other treatments more effective, reduce the risk of the cancer coming back after surgery, or provide palliative relief from symptoms."
3,How is external radiotherapy given?,<noinput>,"External radiotherapy involves using a machine to aim beams of radiation at the cancer. It is usually given in a hospital setting, and the patient can usually go home soon after the treatment."
4,Can radiotherapy make you radioactive?,<noinput>,"External radiotherapy does not make you radioactive, as the radiation passes through your body. However, radiation from implants or injections may stay in your body for a few days, requiring precautions and limited contact with others."
5,What are the purposes of curative radiotherapy?,<noinput>,Curative radiotherapy aims to completely cure the cancer by using radiation to kill cancer cells. It is typically used in the early stages of cancer.
6,How can radiotherapy be combined with other treatments?,<noinput>,Radiotherapy can be combined with chemotherapy or used before surgery to make the other treatments more effective. This is known as neo-adjuvant radiotherapy.
7,What is the role of adjuvant radiotherapy?,<noinput>,Adjuvant radiotherapy is used after surgery to reduce the risk of the cancer coming back. It is given to patients who may still have cancer cells remaining in the body.
8,What is the purpose of palliative radiotherapy?,<noinput>,Palliative radiotherapy is used to relieve symptoms when a cure for the cancer is not possible. It aims to improve the patient's quality of life and alleviate pain or discomfort.
9,Is intrabeam radiotherapy available at all hospitals?,<noinput>,"No, intrabeam radiotherapy is not available at all NHS hospitals. It is a specific type of radiotherapy that delivers radiation directly at the tumor during breast cancer surgery."
0,What are the different types of radiotherapy?,<noinput>,"The most common types of radiotherapy are external radiotherapy, radiotherapy implants (brachytherapy), radiotherapy injections/capsules/drinks (radioisotope therapy), and intrabeam radiotherapy."
1,What are the side effects of radiotherapy?,<noinput>,"Side effects of radiotherapy can include sore skin, fatigue, hair loss, nausea, loss of appetite, sore mouth, and diarrhea. However, many of these side effects can be treated or prevented and most will go away after treatment stops."
2,When is radiotherapy used?,<noinput>,"Radiotherapy may be used in the early stages of cancer or after it has started to spread. It can be used for curative purposes, to make other treatments more effective, to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence after surgery, or to relieve symptoms if a cure is not possible."
3,How is external radiotherapy delivered?,<noinput>,External radiotherapy involves aiming beams of radiation at the cancer using a machine. It is usually given in a hospital and patients can usually go home soon after the treatment.
4,Can radiotherapy make you radioactive?,<noinput>,"External radiotherapy does not make you radioactive as the radiation passes through your body. However, radiation from implants or injections can stay in the body for a few days, so precautions may be necessary."
5,What should I do if I experience side effects during radiotherapy?,<noinput>,"If you experience side effects during radiotherapy, it is important to communicate with your care team. Many side effects can be managed with appropriate treatment and support."
6,Is intrabeam radiotherapy available at all hospitals?,<noinput>,"No, intrabeam radiotherapy is not available at all NHS hospitals. It is a treatment where radiation is delivered directly at the tumor during breast cancer surgery."
7,How long does radiation from implants or injections stay in the body?,<noinput>,"Radiation from implants or injections can stay in the body for a few days. During this time, it is recommended to stay in the hospital and avoid close contact with other people as a precaution."
8,Can the side effects of radiotherapy be treated or prevented?,<noinput>,"Yes, many of the side effects of radiotherapy can be treated or prevented. Your care team will provide appropriate measures to manage these side effects."
9,What happens during radiotherapy?,<noinput>,"During radiotherapy, beams of radiation are carefully aimed at the cancer. If you want to learn more about the process, you can watch a video where an expert describes what happens and provides advice on questions to ask when referred for radiotherapy."
