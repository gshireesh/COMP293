0,What is supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)?,<noinput>,"Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a condition where your heart suddenly beats much faster than normal. It's not usually serious, but some people may need treatment."
1,What causes supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)?,<noinput>,SVT happens when the electrical system that controls your heart rhythm is not working properly. This causes your heart to suddenly beat much faster. It can then slow down abruptly.
2,What are the symptoms of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)?,<noinput>,"Having SVT means your heart suddenly beats faster. It usually lasts for a few minutes, but can sometimes last for several hours. It can happen several times a day or once a year. It can be triggered by tiredness, caffeine, alcohol, or drugs. But often there's no obvious trigger. You may have no other symptoms, but sometimes people also experience chest pain, weakness, breathlessness, lightheadedness, tiredness, or nausea."
3,When should I see a doctor if I have a fast heartbeat?,<noinput>,"You should see a GP if you keep getting a fast heartbeat. It's important to get it checked out. You might need a test, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG), to find out what's going on."
4,What should I do if my supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) episode lasts longer than 30 minutes?,<noinput>,"If you have been diagnosed with SVT and your episode has lasted longer than 30 minutes, you should call 999 or go to A&E. You may need to go to the hospital for treatment immediately."
5,What are some things I can do to help with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)?,<noinput>,"If your episodes of SVT only last a few minutes and do not bother you, you may not need treatment. You can make changes to your lifestyle to reduce your chances of having episodes, such as cutting down on the amount of caffeine or alcohol you drink, stopping or cutting back on smoking, and making sure you get enough rest. Your doctor may also be able to recommend some simple techniques to help stop episodes when they happen."
6,Is supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) life-threatening?,<noinput>,"SVT is rarely life-threatening. However, if you keep having long episodes, you may need treatment in the hospital."
7,What are the treatment options for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) in the hospital?,<noinput>,"If you keep having long episodes of SVT, the treatment options in the hospital may include medicines to control the episodes, cardioversion (a small electric shock to the heart to help it get back to a normal rhythm), and catheter ablation (a treatment where thin tubes are placed through a vein or artery into your heart to correct the problem with the electrical system, which permanently cures the problem in most patients)."
8,How can cardioversion help in treating supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)?,<noinput>,Cardioversion is a treatment for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) that involves a small electric shock to the heart to help it get back to a normal rhythm.
9,What is catheter ablation and how does it help in treating supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)?,<noinput>,Catheter ablation is a treatment for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) where thin tubes are placed through a vein or artery into your heart to correct the problem with the electrical system. This procedure permanently cures the problem in most patients.

2,What are the symptoms of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of SVT include a sudden increase in heart rate, which usually lasts for a few minutes but can sometimes last for several hours. It can be triggered by tiredness, caffeine, alcohol, or drugs, but often there's no obvious trigger. Other symptoms may include chest pain, weakness, breathlessness, lightheadedness, tiredness, or nausea."

4,When should I seek immediate medical attention for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)?,<noinput>,"You should call 999 or go to A&E if you have been diagnosed with SVT and your episode has lasted longer than 30 minutes, or if you have sudden shortness of breath with chest pain. In such cases, you need to go to the hospital for immediate treatment."

However, you can make changes to your lifestyle to reduce the chances of having episodes. These include cutting down on caffeine and alcohol, quitting or reducing smoking, and ensuring you get enough rest. Your doctor may also recommend some techniques to help stop episodes when they happen."

This may include medicines to control the episodes, cardioversion (a small electric shock to the heart), or catheter ablation (a treatment to correct the problem with the electrical system)."
7,What is cardioversion?,<noinput>,Cardioversion is a procedure that involves delivering a small electric shock to the heart to help it return to a normal rhythm. You can find out more about cardioversion from the British Heart Foundation.
8,What is catheter ablation?,<noinput>,Catheter ablation is a treatment for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) where thin tubes are placed through a vein or artery into your heart to correct the problem with the electrical system. It is a permanent cure for SVT in most patients. You can find out more about catheter ablation from the British Heart Foundation.
9,Is supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) life-threatening?,<noinput>,"SVT is rarely life-threatening, but it is important to seek medical attention if you experience long episodes or severe symptoms. Your doctor can provide further evaluation and determine the necessary treatment."
