7,How can hip-healthy swaddling reduce the risk of DDH?,"A baby's hips are naturally more flexible for a short period after birth. But if your baby spends a lot of time tightly wrapped (swaddled) with their legs straight and pressed together, there's a risk this may affect their hip development.",Hip-healthy swaddling techniques can reduce the risk of DDH by allowing the baby to move their hips and knees freely.
