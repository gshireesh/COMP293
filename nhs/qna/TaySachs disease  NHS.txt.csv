1,How is Tay-Sachs disease inherited?,<noinput>,"Tay-Sachs disease is inherited when both parents have the faulty gene. If both parents are carriers, there's a chance the child may inherit the faulty gene and develop Tay-Sachs disease."
2,When should I seek medical advice if I suspect Tay-Sachs disease?,<noinput>,"You should speak to your GP if you're planning a pregnancy and have a family history of Tay-Sachs disease, if you're pregnant and concerned your baby could have the disease, or if your child is showing symptoms."
3,Is there a cure for Tay-Sachs disease?,<noinput>,"Currently, there is no cure for Tay-Sachs disease. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and improving quality of life."
4,What treatments are available for Tay-Sachs disease?,<noinput>,"Treatments for Tay-Sachs disease may include medication for seizures and stiffness, speech and language therapy, physiotherapy, and antibiotics to treat infections."
5,Where can I get more information and support for Tay-Sachs disease?,<noinput>,"You can seek information and support from organizations such as the Cure & Action for Tay-Sachs Foundation, Climb, and the National Tay-Sachs & Allied Diseases Association."
6,Is there any research being done for treatments of Tay-Sachs disease?,<noinput>,"If you're interested in research for Tay-Sachs disease, you can ask your care team about any ongoing research studies you may be able to get involved in."
7,What is the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service?,<noinput>,The National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service is a register that collects information about individuals with Tay-Sachs disease to help scientists find better ways to prevent and treat the condition.
8,Can I opt out of the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service?,<noinput>,"Yes, you can opt out of the register at any time if you wish."
9,Where can I find more information on the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service?,<noinput>,You can find more information on the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service register on the GOV.UK website.

1,How is Tay-Sachs disease inherited?,<noinput>,"Tay-Sachs disease is inherited when both parents have a faulty gene. If 2 carriers have a child, there's a 25% chance the child won't have the disease, a 50% chance they will be a carrier, and a 25% chance they will develop Tay-Sachs disease."
2,When should I seek medical advice about Tay-Sachs disease?,<noinput>,"You should speak to your GP if you're planning a pregnancy and have a family history of Tay-Sachs disease, if you're concerned your baby could have the disease, or if you notice symptoms in your child."
3,What are the treatments available for Tay-Sachs disease?,<noinput>,"Currently, there is no cure for Tay-Sachs disease. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and may include medications for seizures and stiffness, speech and language therapy, physiotherapy, and antibiotics to treat infections."
4,Where can I get further information and support for Tay-Sachs disease?,<noinput>,"You can get more information and support from organizations such as the Cure & Action for Tay-Sachs (CATS) Foundation, Climb, Genetic Alliance UK, and the National Tay-Sachs & Allied Diseases Association (NTSAD)."
5,What is the aim of treatment for Tay-Sachs disease?,<noinput>,The aim of treatment for Tay-Sachs disease is to make living with the condition as comfortable as possible by managing symptoms and providing support through a care team.
6,Can Tay-Sachs disease be diagnosed through a blood test?,<noinput>,"Yes, a blood test can determine if a child has Tay-Sachs disease by detecting the presence of the disease-causing genes."
7,Are there different types of Tay-Sachs disease?,<noinput>,"Yes, there are different types of Tay-Sachs disease, including infantile Tay-Sachs disease, juvenile Tay-Sachs disease, and late-onset Tay-Sachs disease, each with varying onset and severity of symptoms."
8,What can be expected in terms of life expectancy for late-onset Tay-Sachs disease?,<noinput>,"Late-onset Tay-Sachs disease does not always shorten life expectancy, but the prognosis can vary depending on the individual and the progression of the disease."
9,How can I contribute to research on Tay-Sachs disease?,<noinput>,You can inquire with your care team about any research opportunities that you might be able to participate in to contribute to the development of treatments for Tay-Sachs disease.
