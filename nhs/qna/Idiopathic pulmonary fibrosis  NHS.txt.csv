2,What tests can be done to diagnose idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?,<noinput>,"If a GP suspects idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, they may refer you to a hospital specialist for tests such as lung function tests, blood tests, chest X-ray and CT scan, or a lung biopsy."
3,What are the possible causes of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?,<noinput>,"The exact cause of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is unknown. However, it has been linked to factors such as exposure to certain types of dust, viral infections, family history of IPF, acid reflux, and smoking."
4,Are there any treatments available for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?,<noinput>,"While there is no cure for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, there are treatments available to relieve symptoms and slow down its progression. These include self-care measures, medications, oxygen therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation, and in some cases, a lung transplant."
5,How is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis treated?,<noinput>,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis can be treated with self-care measures such as quitting smoking, maintaining a healthy diet, and regular exercise. Medications like pirfenidone and nintedanib can help reduce scarring, and pulmonary rehabilitation programs can provide exercises and advice for easier breathing. In severe cases, a lung transplant may be an option."
6,What is the outlook for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?,<noinput>,"The progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis varies from person to person. Some may respond well to treatment and have relatively few symptoms for many years, while others may experience rapid deterioration. Other complications, such as chest infections or heart problems, may also develop. Regular monitoring can help determine the rate of progression."
7,What is the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service?,<noinput>,The National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) collects information about patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis to aid in research and improve prevention and treatment methods. Patients can choose to opt out of the register at any time.

Regular monitoring can help determine the progression of the disease."
7,What is the role of the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service?,<noinput>,"If you have idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), your clinical team will share information about you with the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) to help scientists find better ways to prevent and treat IPF."
