7,What are the risk factors for chronic myeloid leukaemia?,Some common risk factors for chronic myeloid leukaemia include exposure to high levels of radiation and certain genetic factors.,Common risk factors for chronic myeloid leukaemia include exposure to high levels of radiation and specific genetic factors.
8,How is chronic myeloid leukaemia diagnosed?,<noinput>,"Chronic myeloid leukaemia is diagnosed through a combination of blood tests, bone marrow biopsy, and genetic tests to identify the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome."
9,Can chronic myeloid leukaemia be cured?,"While there is no known cure for chronic myeloid leukaemia, advancements in treatment have allowed many patients to achieve long-term remission and lead productive lives.","Although chronic myeloid leukaemia cannot be cured, advancements in treatments have enabled many patients to achieve long-term remission and maintain a good quality of life."
