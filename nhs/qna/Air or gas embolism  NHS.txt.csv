0,What are the symptoms of an air or gas embolism after scuba diving?,Air or gas embolism in scuba divers,"Symptoms of an air or gas embolism after diving include joint or muscle pain, low blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, breathlessness, blurred vision, chest pain, anxiety, itchy skin, blue tinge to the skin, bloody froth from the mouth, paralysis or weakness, seizures, and loss of consciousness."
1,What should I do if someone feels unwell after scuba diving and I suspect an air or gas embolism?,Air or gas embolism in scuba divers,Call 999 and ask for an ambulance immediately if someone feels unwell after scuba diving and you suspect an air or gas embolism.
2,How should a diver with a suspected air or gas embolism be treated?,Air or gas embolism in scuba divers,"A diver with a suspected air or gas embolism should be transferred to an A&E department as soon as possible. They should be laid down flat and given 100% oxygen until they reach the hospital. Once stabilized, they'll be taken to a hyperbaric chamber for further treatment."
3,What happens in a hyperbaric chamber during the treatment of an air or gas embolism?,A person being treated in a hyperbaric chamber,"In a hyperbaric chamber, the patient lies down for several hours and breathes a mixture of gases and oxygen in a pressurized environment. The high pressure restores normal blood flow, reduces the size of air bubbles, and allows the bubbles of nitrogen to dissolve into the bloodstream. The pressure is gradually reduced to mimic surfacing from a dive."
4,What can be done to prevent an air or gas embolism while diving?,Preventing an air or gas embolism while diving,"To reduce the risk, limit the depth and duration of your dives, surface slowly and perform safety stops, relax and breathe normally as you ascend, avoid diving with cold or chest infection, avoid vigorous exercise before and after diving, stay hydrated, leave adequate surface intervals between dives, and wait 24 hours before flying or going to a higher altitude."
5,What are other causes of air or gas embolisms?,<noinput>,"Although uncommon, air or gas embolisms can also occur during surgery, some medical procedures, and when ascending to a high altitude. Care should be taken to prevent air embolisms in hospitals and health centers by using proper techniques and closely monitoring patients."
6,How can air embolisms caused by surgery or medical procedures be treated?,<noinput>,"Air embolisms caused by surgery or medical procedures may require treatment to support the heart, blood vessels, and lungs. Fluids and oxygen may be used to address blood pressure and oxygen levels. In some cases, treatment in a hyperbaric chamber may also be necessary."
7,What are the symptoms of an air or gas embolism after diving?,Symptoms of an air or gas embolism after diving include,"joint or muscle pain, low blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, breathlessness, blurred vision, chest pain, anxiety, itchy skin, blue tinge to the skin, bloody froth from the mouth, paralysis or weakness, seizures, and loss of consciousness."
8,How can an air or gas embolism occur in scuba divers?,Air or gas embolism in scuba divers,"An air or gas embolism can occur in scuba divers if they spend too long underwater, surface too quickly, or hold their breath as they come up. Air can escape from the lungs into the blood vessels or nitrogen bubbles can form in the blood vessels."
9,Why is it important to get medical help immediately for an air or gas embolism after diving?,Air or gas embolism in scuba divers,"The symptoms of an air or gas embolism can develop within 10 to 20 minutes or longer after surfacing. It is crucial to not ignore these symptoms and seek immediate medical help, as untreated air or gas embolisms can cause serious and potentially fatal conditions such as stroke or heart attack."
0,What is an air or gas embolism?,<noinput>,An air or gas embolism is a bubble that becomes trapped in a blood vessel and blocks it.
1,What can cause an air or gas embolism in scuba divers?,<noinput>,"An air or gas embolism can happen if a scuba diver spends too long underwater, surfaces too quickly, or holds their breath as they come up."
2,What are the symptoms of an air or gas embolism after diving?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of an air or gas embolism after diving include joint or muscle pain, low blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, breathlessness, blurred vision, chest pain, anxiety, itchy skin, cyanosis, froth from the mouth, paralysis or weakness, seizures, or loss of consciousness."
3,What should you do if you suspect an air or gas embolism after scuba diving?,<noinput>,"If you suspect an air or gas embolism after scuba diving, you should call 999 and ask for an ambulance immediately."
4,How should a diver with a suspected air or gas embolism be treated?,<noinput>,"A diver with a suspected air or gas embolism should be transferred to an A&E department as soon as possible, laid down flat, and given 100% oxygen until they reach the hospital. They may also be taken to a hyperbaric chamber for further treatment."
5,What is the treatment for an air or gas embolism caused by diving?,<noinput>,"After receiving emergency medical attention, a diver with an air or gas embolism will be transferred to a hyperbaric chamber. They will need to lie in the chamber for several hours, breathing a mixture of gases and oxygen in a pressurized environment."
6,How can you reduce the risk of getting an air or gas embolism while diving?,<noinput>,"To reduce the risk of getting an air or gas embolism while diving, you should limit the depth and duration of your dives, always surface slowly, perform safety stops, relax and breathe normally as you ascend, avoid diving with a cold or cough, and leave adequate surface intervals between dives."
7,What are the other causes of air or gas embolisms?,<noinput>,"Air or gas embolisms can also occur during surgery, some medical procedures, and when ascending to a high altitude."
8,How can air embolisms be prevented during medical procedures?,<noinput>,"To prevent air embolisms during medical procedures, care should be taken to remove air from syringes and intravenous lines, and to use techniques that minimize the risk of air getting into blood vessels when inserting or removing catheters and other tubes."
9,How are air embolisms caused by surgery or medical procedures treated?,<noinput>,"Air embolisms caused by surgery or medical procedures are treated by supporting the heart, blood vessels, and lungs. Fluids may be used to treat a fall in blood pressure, and oxygen may be given to correct reduced oxygen levels. Treatment in a hyperbaric chamber may be needed in some cases."
