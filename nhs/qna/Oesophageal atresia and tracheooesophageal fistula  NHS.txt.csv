0,What is oesophageal atresia?,<noinput>,"Oesophageal atresia is a rare birth defect where the upper part of the esophagus does not connect with the lower esophagus and stomach, resulting in difficulty or inability to swallow."
1,What is the cause of oesophageal atresia?,<noinput>,"The exact cause of oesophageal atresia is unknown, but it is thought to be a result of developmental issues in the womb. It is more common in babies of mothers who had polyhydramnios (excess amniotic fluid) during pregnancy, as well as in babies with kidney, heart, and spine problems."
2,How is oesophageal atresia diagnosed?,<noinput>,"Oesophageal atresia can be suspected during routine ultrasound scans if there is a large amount of amniotic fluid in the womb. After birth, tests such as passing a feeding tube through the nose and an X-ray of the oesophagus can confirm the condition."
3,What is the treatment for oesophageal atresia?,<noinput>,"Surgery is necessary to repair the defects in oesophageal atresia. The procedure is usually done soon after birth and involves closing off the abnormal connection between the oesophagus and windpipe, as well as joining the upper and lower parts of the oesophagus together."
4,What are the risks of surgery for oesophageal atresia?,<noinput>,"The risks of surgery for oesophageal atresia include bleeding, infection, food or air leakage from the repaired area, narrowing of the oesophagus, and reopening of the connection between the oesophagus and windpipe. Additional procedures may be required to address these issues."
5,What are the potential problems after surgery for oesophageal atresia?,<noinput>,"After surgery, potential problems include swallowing difficulties, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), asthma-like symptoms, recurrent chest infections, and tracheomalacia (floppiness of the repaired windpipe section). Regular monitoring and early treatment can help manage these problems."
6,How long does it take for a baby with oesophageal atresia to be able to go home?,<noinput>,"The time it takes for a baby with oesophageal atresia to go home varies, but it usually takes around a week or two once they are able to safely swallow food. Parents will receive guidance on feeding their child and may be referred to a dietitian for specific advice."
7,What support is available for families of children with oesophageal atresia?,<noinput>,Tracheo-Oesophageal Fistula Support (TOFS) is a charity that provides support for individuals with oesophageal atresia and their families. They offer resources and a helpline for assistance.
8,What is the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service?,<noinput>,The National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) collects information about oesophageal atresia and other rare diseases to aid research and understanding. Parents have the option to opt out of the register.
9,Which organs are affected by oesophageal atresia?,<noinput>,"In oesophageal atresia, the oesophagus (food pipe) and the windpipe (trachea) are affected. The upper part of the oesophagus doesn't connect with the lower oesophagus and stomach, and there can be an abnormal connection (fistula) between the oesophagus and trachea."
0,What is oesophageal atresia?,<noinput>,"Oesophageal atresia is a rare birth defect where the upper part of the oesophagus doesn't connect with the lower oesophagus and stomach, causing difficulty or inability to swallow safely."
1,What can happen if oesophageal atresia is not treated quickly?,<noinput>,"If oesophageal atresia is not treated quickly, the baby can develop life-threatening problems such as choking and pneumonia."
2,What are the causes of oesophageal atresia?,<noinput>,"Oesophageal atresia is thought to be caused by a problem with the development of the oesophagus while the baby is in the womb. It may be more common in babies of mothers who had too much amniotic fluid during pregnancy and in babies with problems in their kidneys, heart, and spine."
3,How is oesophageal atresia diagnosed?,<noinput>,Oesophageal atresia can be diagnosed through routine ultrasound scans that show excess amniotic fluid in the womb or if the baby has difficulty swallowing or breathing. Tests such as passing a thin feeding tube and an X-ray of the oesophagus may be done to confirm the condition.
4,What is the procedure to repair oesophageal atresia?,<noinput>,The surgical repair of oesophageal atresia and tracheo-oesophageal fistula usually takes place soon after birth. The operation involves closing off the abnormal connection between the oesophagus and windpipe and sewing together the upper and lower parts of the oesophagus.
5,What happens after the surgery to repair oesophageal atresia?,<noinput>,"After the surgery, the child will be kept in the intensive care unit and may need antibiotics, assistance in breathing, drainage tubes, and pain medication. Initially, the child will receive nutrition intravenously and gradually transition to feeding through a tube into the stomach."
6,When can a baby go home after surgery for oesophageal atresia?,<noinput>,"A baby can usually go home once they are able to take food by mouth, which typically takes about a week or two after the surgery. Parents will receive guidance on feeding techniques and may be recommended breast or bottle feeding initially."
7,What are the risks of surgery for oesophageal atresia?,<noinput>,"The risks of surgery for oesophageal atresia include bleeding, infection, food or air leakage from the repaired area, narrowing of the oesophagus, and reopening of the connection between the oesophagus and windpipe. Additional procedures may be required to address these issues."
8,What are the potential long-term problems after surgery for oesophageal atresia?,<noinput>,"After surgery, children may experience swallowing difficulties, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), asthma-like symptoms, recurrent chest infections, or tracheomalacia. Continuous monitoring and early treatment can help manage these problems, which may improve as the child grows older."
9,Are there any support organizations for oesophageal atresia?,<noinput>,"Tracheo-Oesophageal Fistula Support (TOFS) is a charity that provides support to individuals born with oesophageal atresia and tracheo-oesophageal fistula, as well as their families. Their website and helpline are available for further assistance."
10,Does oesophageal atresia need to be reported to a registration service?,<noinput>,"Clinical teams typically pass information about babies with oesophageal atresia to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS). This registry helps researchers gain a better understanding of the condition, but individuals can opt out at any time."
