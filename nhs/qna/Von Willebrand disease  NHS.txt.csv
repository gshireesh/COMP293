0,What is von Willebrand disease?,<noinput>,"Von Willebrand disease is an inherited condition that affects blood clotting. People with VWD have a low level of von Willebrand factor, a substance that helps blood cells stick together and form clots."
1,What are the symptoms of von Willebrand disease?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of VWD can vary from mild to severe and include easy bruising, frequent nosebleeds, bleeding gums, heavy or prolonged bleeding from cuts, heavy periods, and bleeding after surgery or tooth removal."
2,When should I seek medical help for von Willebrand disease?,<noinput>,"You should see a GP if you have symptoms of VWD, especially if someone in your family has it. If you experience heavy bleeding that does not stop, or if you're pregnant or planning a pregnancy, go to A&E."
3,How is von Willebrand disease treated?,<noinput>,"There is no cure for VWD, but it can be managed with medications and lifestyle measures. These may include applying pressure to wounds, using medications to control bleeding, and considering treatments to manage heavy periods."
4,What are the types of von Willebrand disease?,<noinput>,"There are three main types of VWD: type 1, type 2, and type 3. Type 1 is the mildest and most common, while type 3 is the most severe. There's also a rare acquired type that is not inherited."
5,How is von Willebrand disease inherited?,<noinput>,VWD is often caused by a genetic fault in the gene responsible for producing von Willebrand factor. The type of VWD a person has depends on whether they inherit copies of the faulty gene from one or both parents.
6,What are the risks of pregnancy with von Willebrand disease?,<noinput>,"There are potential risks associated with pregnancy and VWD, including the risk of the child being born with VWD and the risk of heavy bleeding during or after labor. It's important to speak to a doctor about your options if you're planning to have a baby."
7,What is the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service?,<noinput>,The National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) is a service that collects information about individuals with VWD to help researchers find better ways to prevent and treat the condition.
8,How can VWD be controlled?,<noinput>,"VWD can be controlled with medications and lifestyle measures. Applying pressure to wounds, using medications to stop bleeding, and managing heavy periods are some of the ways to control VWD."
9,What are the treatment options for heavy periods caused by VWD?,<noinput>,"There are various treatment options for heavy periods caused by VWD, including the use of oral contraceptive pills, intrauterine systems, tranexamic acid tablets, desmopressin nasal spray, and von Willebrand factor concentrate."
0,What is Von Willebrand disease?,<noinput>,"Von Willebrand disease is an inherited condition that affects blood clotting, leading to easy bruising, nosebleeds, bleeding gums, heavy periods, and prolonged bleeding from cuts."
1,How is Von Willebrand disease diagnosed?,<noinput>,"Von Willebrand disease can be diagnosed through blood tests that measure the level and function of von Willebrand factor, as well as genetic testing."
2,What are the types of Von Willebrand disease?,<noinput>,"The main types of Von Willebrand disease are type 1, type 2, and type 3. Type 1 is the mildest and most common form, while type 3 is the most severe and rarest form."
3,How is Von Willebrand disease inherited?,<noinput>,Von Willebrand disease is usually inherited from one or both parents due to a fault in the gene responsible for von Willebrand factor production. The type of VWD a person is born with depends on the inheritance pattern and whether they inherit the faulty gene from one or both parents.
4,What are the symptoms of Von Willebrand disease?,<noinput>,"The symptoms of Von Willebrand disease can include large bruises, frequent nosebleeds, bleeding gums, heavy or prolonged bleeding from cuts, heavy periods in women, and bleeding after tooth removal or surgery."
5,How can bleeds be treated in Von Willebrand disease?,<noinput>,"Bleeds in Von Willebrand disease can be treated with medicines such as desmopressin, tranexamic acid, or von Willebrand factor concentrate. Pressure can also be applied to wounds to stop bleeding."
6,When should I seek medical help for Von Willebrand disease?,<noinput>,"You should see a GP if you have symptoms of Von Willebrand disease, especially if someone else in your family has it. In case of heavy bleeding or bleeding that does not stop, it is advised to go to A&E."
7,How can Von Willebrand disease be controlled?,<noinput>,"Von Willebrand disease can usually be controlled with medications and lifestyle measures. Medications can help stop bleeding, and lifestyle measures include informing healthcare professionals about the condition, avoiding aspirin and anti-inflammatory drugs, and taking precautions during procedures or operations."
8,Can I have children if I have Von Willebrand disease?,<noinput>,"Yes, you can have children if you have Von Willebrand disease. However, there is a risk of your child being born with VWD, and you may experience heavy bleeding during or after labor. It is recommended to consult with your doctor about your options and undergo genetic testing."
9,What is the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service?,<noinput>,The National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) is a service that collects information about individuals with Von Willebrand disease and other rare diseases in order to improve prevention and treatment methods.
