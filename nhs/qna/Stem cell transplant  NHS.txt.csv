0,What are the 3 main types of blood cells that stem cells can become?,<noinput>,"The 3 main types of blood cells that stem cells can become are red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets."
1,What conditions can stem cell transplants be used to treat?,<noinput>,"Stem cell transplants can be used to treat severe aplastic anaemia, leukaemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and certain blood, immune system, and metabolic disorders."
2,What are the 5 main stages of a stem cell transplant?,<noinput>,"The 5 main stages of a stem cell transplant are tests and examinations, harvesting, conditioning, transplanting the stem cells, and recovery."
3,What are the risks of having a stem cell transplant?,<noinput>,"The risks of having a stem cell transplant include graft versus host disease (GvHD), reduced number of blood cells, and chemotherapy side effects."
4,How long does it take to fully recover from a stem cell transplant?,<noinput>,It can take up to a year or longer to fully recover from a stem cell transplant.
5,What is graft versus host disease (GvHD)?,<noinput>,Graft versus host disease (GvHD) occurs in allogeneic transplants when the transplanted cells start to attack the other cells in the recipient's body.
6,Who can be a stem cell donor?,<noinput>,"A stem cell donor can be a close family member, such as a brother or sister. If no matches are found in the close family, a search of the British Bone Marrow Registry will be carried out."
7,What is the importance of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) in stem cell donation?,<noinput>,Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is a special genetic marker that needs to be identical or very similar between the donor and the recipient to improve the chances of a successful transplant.
8,Where can I find more information about stem cell and bone marrow donation?,<noinput>,More information about stem cell and bone marrow donation can be found on the NHS Blood and Transplant website and the Anthony Nolan website.
9,How can stem cells be harvested for a transplant?,<noinput>,"Stem cells can be harvested from the blood or bone marrow of a donor, or they can be removed from the recipient's own body and transplanted later."
0,What are the 3 main types of blood cells that stem cells can become?,<noinput>,"The 3 main types of blood cells that stem cells can become are red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets."
1,When are stem cell transplants carried out?,<noinput>,"Stem cell transplants are carried out to treat conditions in which the bone marrow is damaged and unable to produce healthy blood cells, or to replace blood cells damaged by intensive cancer treatment."
2,What are the 5 main stages of a stem cell transplant?,<noinput>,"The 5 main stages of a stem cell transplant are tests and examinations, harvesting of stem cells, conditioning with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, transplanting the stem cells, and recovery."
3,What are some risks associated with stem cell transplants?,<noinput>,"Some risks of stem cell transplants include graft versus host disease (GvHD), reduced number of blood cells leading to anemia or increased infection risk, and chemotherapy side effects."
4,How can stem cells be obtained if it is not possible to use the patient's own stem cells?,<noinput>,"If it is not possible to use the patient's own stem cells, stem cells can be obtained from a donor who carries a genetic marker (HLA) compatible with the recipient."
5,What are the chances of finding a suitable stem cell donor from a close family member?,<noinput>,"The best chance of finding a suitable stem cell donor is from a brother, sister, or close family member."
6,Where can I find more information about stem cell and bone marrow donation?,<noinput>,More information about stem cell and bone marrow donation can be found on the NHS Blood and Transplant website and the Anthony Nolan website.
7,What is graft versus host disease (GvHD)?,<noinput>,"Graft versus host disease (GvHD) is a condition that can occur in allogeneic transplants, where transplanted cells start to attack the recipient's cells."
8,What are some possible problems during or after the stem cell transplant process?,<noinput>,"Possible problems during or after the stem cell transplant process include graft versus host disease (GvHD), reduced number of blood cells, and chemotherapy side effects."
9,How long does it take to fully recover after a stem cell transplant?,<noinput>,It can take up to a year or longer to fully recover after a stem cell transplant.
