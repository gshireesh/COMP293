0,What is thalassaemia?,<noinput>,"Thalassaemia is a group of inherited conditions that affect the production of the blood protein hemoglobin, resulting in anemia."
1,What are the symptoms of thalassaemia?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of thalassaemia include severe tiredness, shortness of breath, irregular heartbeats, pale skin, and excess iron in the body."
2,What causes thalassaemia?,<noinput>,"Thalassaemia is caused by faulty genes inherited from both parents, affecting the production of hemoglobin."
3,How is thalassaemia detected?,<noinput>,Thalassaemia can be detected during pregnancy or soon after birth through screening tests or blood tests at any age.
4,What are the treatments for thalassaemia?,<noinput>,Treatments for thalassaemia include regular blood transfusions and chelation therapy to remove excess iron from the body.
5,Can thalassaemia be cured?,<noinput>,"The only potential cure for thalassaemia is a stem cell or bone marrow transplant, but it is not commonly performed."
6,What is the outlook for thalassaemia?,<noinput>,"With proper treatment and monitoring, individuals with thalassaemia can have a relatively normal life expectancy."
7,What is thalassaemia trait?,<noinput>,"Thalassaemia trait refers to being a carrier of the faulty gene that causes thalassaemia, without developing the condition itself."
8,How can thalassaemia carriers have children with thalassaemia?,<noinput>,"If both partners are carriers of thalassaemia, there is a risk of having children with the condition."
9,What is the role of National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service?,<noinput>,The National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service collects information to assist in research and improve thalassaemia prevention and treatment.
10,Where can I find more information about thalassaemia?,<noinput>,The UK Thalassaemia Society provides useful information and news about thalassaemia on their website.
0,What is thalassaemia?,<noinput>,"Thalassaemia is a group of inherited conditions that affect the production of hemoglobin in the blood, resulting in severe anemia and other health problems."
1,What are the symptoms of thalassaemia?,<noinput>,"The symptoms of thalassaemia include severe tiredness, weakness, shortness of breath, palpitations, pale skin, and can also lead to complications such as iron overload and delayed growth."
2,What causes thalassaemia?,<noinput>,Thalassaemia is caused by faulty genes that affect the production of hemoglobin. It is inherited when both parents pass on the faulty genes to their child.
3,How is thalassaemia detected?,<noinput>,Thalassaemia can be detected during pregnancy through screening tests. It can also be diagnosed soon after birth or at any age through blood tests.
4,What are the treatments for thalassaemia?,<noinput>,"The main treatments for thalassaemia include regular blood transfusions to treat anemia and chelation therapy to remove excess iron from the body. A stem cell or bone marrow transplant is a potential cure, but it is done only in rare cases due to the risks involved."
5,What is the outlook for thalassaemia?,<noinput>,"With close monitoring and regular treatment, people with thalassaemia can manage the associated health problems and live into their 50s, 60s, and beyond. However, it still has a significant impact on a person's life and may require lifelong care."
6,What is a thalassaemia carrier?,<noinput>,"A thalassaemia carrier carries the faulty gene for thalassaemia but does not have the condition themselves. Being a carrier does not generally cause health problems, although mild anemia may occur. Carriers have a higher risk of having a child with thalassaemia if their partner is also a carrier."
7,What is the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service?,<noinput>,The National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) is a service that collects information about individuals with thalassaemia to help researchers find better ways to prevent and treat the condition.
8,Where can I find more information about thalassaemia?,<noinput>,The UK Thalassaemia Society (UKTS) is a charity that provides useful information and resources for individuals with thalassaemia. Their website contains news about research and updates on the condition.
9,Can you cure thalassaemia?,<noinput>,"The only possible cure for thalassaemia is a stem cell or bone marrow transplant, but this procedure is not commonly performed due to the associated risks."
