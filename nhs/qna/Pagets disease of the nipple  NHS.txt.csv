3,Is there a chance of full recovery if Paget's disease of the nipple is detected and treated early?,<noinput>,"Yes, if Paget's disease of the nipple is detected and treated in its early stages, there is a good chance of a full recovery."
4,What are the risk factors for developing Paget's disease of the nipple?,<noinput>,"The exact cause of Paget's disease of the nipple is unknown, but known risk factors for developing breast cancer, in general, include age, family history, previous breast cancer, certain benign breast diseases, being overweight, and alcohol consumption."

1,What are the causes of Paget's disease of the nipple?,<noinput>,"The cause of Paget's disease of the nipple is unknown, but certain risk factors for breast cancer, such as older age, family history, previous breast cancer, benign breast disease, obesity, and excessive alcohol consumption, may increase the risk."
2,How is Paget's disease of the nipple diagnosed?,<noinput>,"Paget's disease of the nipple is diagnosed through a biopsy, where a tissue sample is taken from the nipple and examined under a microscope. A mammogram may also be done to investigate further."

4,"How can the risk of breast cancer, including Paget's disease of the nipple, be reduced?",<noinput>,Modifying lifestyle factors such as reducing alcohol consumption and exercising regularly may reduce the risk of developing breast cancer. Breast cancer screening is also recommended for early detection.
5,What are the risk factors for developing breast cancer?,<noinput>,"Risk factors for developing breast cancer include older age, family history of breast cancer, previous breast cancer diagnosis, certain benign breast diseases, obesity, and excessive alcohol consumption."
6,Are invasive breast cancer and Paget's disease of the nipple always associated with a lump?,<noinput>,"No, while around half of women diagnosed with Paget's disease of the nipple have a lump behind the nipple that indicates invasive breast cancer, most women without a lump have non-invasive cancer."
