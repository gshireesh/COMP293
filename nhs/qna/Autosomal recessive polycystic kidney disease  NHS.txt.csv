0,What are the symptoms of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD)?,<noinput>,"Some symptoms of ARPKD include underdeveloped lungs, high blood pressure, excessive peeing and thirst, problems with blood flow through the liver, and progressive loss of kidney function."
1,How is ARPKD caused?,<noinput>,ARPKD is caused by a genetic fault that disrupts the normal development of the kidneys and liver. It is usually inherited from the parents who carry a faulty version of the PKHD1 gene.
2,What are the treatment options for ARPKD?,<noinput>,"There is currently no cure for ARPKD, but treatments such as breathing assistance, medication for high blood pressure, procedures to stop internal bleeding, and medications to control problems associated with kidney function loss can help manage the condition. In cases of kidney failure, dialysis or kidney transplant may be necessary."
3,What is the outlook for children with ARPKD?,<noinput>,"The outlook for children with ARPKD can vary, but it is a severe condition and around 1 in 3 babies will die from severe breathing difficulties in the first 4 weeks after birth. However, with advances in treatments and a better understanding of the condition, the survival rate has improved, and many children with ARPKD are living into adulthood."
4,What is the role of the kidneys?,<noinput>,The main role of the kidneys is to filter out waste products from the blood before passing them out of the body as urine. The kidneys also help maintain blood pressure at a healthy level.
5,How is ARPKD different from autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)?,<noinput>,"ARPKD is caused by a genetic alteration in the PKHD1 gene and is usually inherited from both parents. ADPKD, on the other hand, is a more common kidney disease and does not cause significantly reduced kidney function until adulthood. It can be inherited even when only one parent has a faulty gene, although this is rare."
6,How is ARPKD treated?,<noinput>,"There is currently no cure for ARPKD, but treatments can help manage the condition. These may include breathing assistance for severe breathing difficulties, medication for high blood pressure, procedures to stop internal bleeding, and medications to control problems associated with kidney function loss. In cases of kidney failure, dialysis or kidney transplant may be necessary."
7,How does ARPKD affect the outlook of children?,<noinput>,"The outlook for children with ARPKD can vary depending on the severity of the condition. Approximately 1 in 3 babies will die from severe breathing difficulties in the first 4 weeks after birth. However, with advancements in treatments and a better understanding of ARPKD, many children with the condition are living well into adulthood."
8,What happens if kidney failure occurs in ARPKD?,<noinput>,"If kidney failure occurs in ARPKD, there are two main treatment options: dialysis, where a machine replicates the functions of the kidney, or a kidney transplant using a healthy kidney from a living or recently deceased donor."
9,What happens to the information of patients with ARPKD?,<noinput>,"If you have ARPKD, your clinical team will pass your information to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) to help scientists find better ways to prevent and treat the condition. You can choose to opt out of the register at any time."

1,How common is ARPKD?,<noinput>,"ARPKD is rare, affecting approximately 1 in 20,000 babies. It affects both boys and girls equally."
2,What causes ARPKD?,<noinput>,ARPKD is caused by a genetic fault that disrupts normal development of the kidneys and liver. It is inherited when both parents carry a faulty version of the PKHD1 gene.
3,What are the treatment options for ARPKD?,<noinput>,"There is no cure for ARPKD, but treatments can help manage the symptoms. These may include breathing assistance, medication for high blood pressure, procedures to stop internal bleeding, and dialysis or kidney transplant in cases of kidney failure."
4,What is the outlook for children with ARPKD?,<noinput>,"The outlook for children with ARPKD varies depending on the severity. About 1 in 3 babies will die from severe breathing difficulties within the first 4 weeks after birth. However, with advances in treatments and better understanding, increasing numbers of children with ARPKD are living well into adulthood."
5,How can I opt out of the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Register?,<noinput>,"You can opt out of the register at any time. For more information, you can visit the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Register on GOV.UK."
6,How do the kidneys function?,<noinput>,The kidneys are bean-shaped organs located on either side of the body. Their main role is to filter waste products from the blood and maintain blood pressure at a healthy level.
7,Can ARPKD be cured?,<noinput>,"Currently, there is no cure for ARPKD, but there are various treatments available to manage the symptoms and complications associated with the condition."
8,Are both boys and girls equally affected by ARPKD?,<noinput>,"Yes, both boys and girls are equally affected by ARPKD."
9,Can ARPKD be diagnosed during pregnancy?,<noinput>,Routine scans during pregnancy can sometimes detect kidney problems associated with ARPKD. The outlook for babies diagnosed during pregnancy may be poorer compared to those diagnosed at a later stage.
