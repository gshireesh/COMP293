0,What is haemophilia?,<noinput>,"Haemophilia is a rare condition that affects the blood's ability to clot. It is usually inherited and most commonly affects males. People with haemophilia do not have enough clotting factors in their blood, causing them to bleed for longer than usual."
1,What are the symptoms of haemophilia?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of haemophilia can range from mild to severe and include bleeding that does not stop, nosebleeds that take a long time to stop, bleeding gums, easy bruising, and pain and stiffness around joints."
2,When should I seek medical advice for haemophilia?,<noinput>,"You should see a doctor (GP) if you or your child bruises easily and has bleeding that does not stop, experiences symptoms of joint bleeds such as tingling or pain, or if you have a family history of haemophilia and are pregnant or planning to have a baby."
3,What are the symptoms of a brain haemorrhage in someone with haemophilia?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of a brain haemorrhage in someone with haemophilia include a severe headache, stiff neck, vomiting, confusion, slurred speech, changes in vision, loss of coordination and balance, and paralysis of some or all the facial muscles. If you suspect someone is bleeding inside their skull, call 999 for an ambulance."
4,How is haemophilia diagnosed?,<noinput>,"Haemophilia is diagnosed through blood tests, which can determine the level of clotting factors in the blood. In cases where there is no family history of haemophilia, it is often diagnosed when a child starts walking or crawling. Genetic tests can also be performed during pregnancy to determine the risk of passing on the condition."
5,What treatments are available for haemophilia?,<noinput>,"While there is no cure for haemophilia, treatment options include the administration of man-made clotting factors as medicines to prevent and treat prolonged bleeding. These medicines are typically given as injections. More severe cases of haemophilia may require regular injections to prevent bleeding."
6,Can people with haemophilia lead a normal life?,<noinput>,"With proper treatment, most people with haemophilia can live a normal life. However, it is important to avoid contact sports and be cautious when taking other medicines that can affect blood clotting, such as aspirin and ibuprofen. Regular dental check-ups are also advised to prevent bleeding due to gum disease."
7,Can you provide information about the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS)?,<noinput>,The NCARDRS is a registry that collects information about individuals with haemophilia and other rare diseases. This information helps scientists gain a better understanding of the condition. You have the option to opt out of the register at any time.
8,How can I find my local haemophilia centre?,<noinput>,"If you have haemophilia, you can register at your local haemophilia centre, which is a valuable source of advice and support. These centres are typically part of a hospital's haematology department. You can find haematology services near you for more information."
9,How can genetic and genomic testing help in determining the risk of passing on haemophilia?,<noinput>,"Genetic and genomic testing can analyze a sample of your tissue or blood to identify the genetic change that causes haemophilia. This testing can help determine the risk of passing the condition on to a child. During pregnancy, procedures like chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis can diagnose haemophilia in the baby."
0,What is haemophilia?,<noinput>,"Haemophilia is a rare condition that affects the blood's ability to clot. People with haemophilia do not have as many clotting factors as they should have in their blood, which leads to prolonged bleeding."
1,What are the symptoms of haemophilia?,<noinput>,"The symptoms of haemophilia can range from mild to severe and include nosebleeds, prolonged bleeding from wounds, bleeding gums, easy bruising, and pain and stiffness around joints due to internal bleeding."
2,When should I seek medical advice for haemophilia?,<noinput>,"You should see a GP if you or your child bruises easily and has bleeding that does not stop, or if you or your child experiences symptoms of joint bleeds such as tingling, pain, or stiffness in a joint. It's also important to seek medical advice if you have a family history of haemophilia and are pregnant or planning to have a baby."

However, it is important to avoid contact sports and be cautious when taking medications that can affect blood clotting. Regular dental check-ups are also recommended to prevent gum disease and bleeding."
7,What information may be shared with the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service?,<noinput>,"If you have haemophilia, your clinical team may pass information about you to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service to help scientists better understand the condition. However, you have the option to opt out of the register at any time."
8,What is the role of a local haemophilia centre?,<noinput>,Registering at a local haemophilia centre can provide valuable advice and support for individuals with haemophilia. These centres are typically part of hospital haematology departments and offer specialized care for people with haemophilia.
9,Are there any risks involved in genetic tests during pregnancy to diagnose haemophilia?,<noinput>,"Genetic tests during pregnancy, such as chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis, carry a small risk of complications such as miscarriage or premature labour. If you are considering these tests, it is important to discuss the potential risks with your doctor."
