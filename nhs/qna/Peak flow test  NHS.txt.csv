4,How can you interpret your peak flow score?,<noinput>,"Your peak flow score can be compared to what is expected for someone of your age, height, and sex to help diagnose asthma. A significant difference in score or variations in score throughout the day may indicate asthma or worsening control of your condition."
5,What should you do if your peak flow is low?,<noinput>,"If your peak flow score falls to a certain level, refer to your personal asthma action plan for guidance.

2,What is a peak flow score and how is it displayed?,<noinput>,"A peak flow score, also known as peak expiratory flow (PEF), is displayed on the side of the peak flow meter. It is measured in liters of air breathed out per minute (l/min). The interpretation of a normal score depends on factors like age, height, and sex."
3,How does a significant difference in peak flow scores indicate asthma?,<noinput>,"A significant difference between your peak flow score and a normal score, or a difference in scores between morning and evening or good and bad symptom days, may suggest the presence of asthma.
