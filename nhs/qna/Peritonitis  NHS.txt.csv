5,How can I get help with eating during peritonitis treatment?,<noinput>,"If you are experiencing difficulties with digestion due to peritonitis, a feeding tube may be inserted through your nose or surgically placed in the stomach. If a feeding tube is not an option, liquid nutrients can be directly given into a vein."
6,Do I need surgery for peritonitis?,<noinput>,"Surgery may be required for peritonitis if there is significant damage to the stomach lining or if abscesses need to be drained. For example, an appendectomy may be necessary if the cause of peritonitis is a burst appendix."
7,What complications can occur if peritonitis is left untreated?,<noinput>,"If peritonitis is left untreated, serious complications such as sepsis can occur if the infection spreads. It is important to seek medical attention if you experience symptoms of peritonitis."
8,Can peritonitis be caused by peritoneal dialysis equipment?,<noinput>,Peritonitis can rarely be caused by bacteria entering peritoneal dialysis equipment used to treat people with kidney failure. This can lead to infection.
9,What should I do if I suspect peritonitis?,<noinput>,"If you suspect you have peritonitis due to symptoms such as tummy pain, high temperature, rapid heartbeat, and decreased urine output, it is important to seek urgent medical advice. Contact your GP or NHS 111 for assistance."
0,What are the symptoms of peritonitis?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of peritonitis include tummy pain, a very high temperature, rapid heartbeat, not being able to pee, lack of appetite, swollen tummy, cloudy fluid in the collection bag during kidney dialysis."
1,What are the causes of peritonitis?,<noinput>,"Peritonitis can be caused by infections in the peritoneum lining, such as burst ulcers or appendix, digestive problems like Crohn's disease or diverticulitis, pancreatitis, injury to the stomach, pelvic inflammatory disease, cirrhosis, or infection through peritoneal dialysis equipment."
2,How is peritonitis treated?,<noinput>,"Peritonitis is usually treated with antibiotics given intravenously. If you have difficulty digesting food, a feeding tube may be inserted or liquid nutrients can be directly given into your veins. In some cases, surgery may be required to remove damaged stomach lining or to address the cause of peritonitis."
3,What should I do if I suspect I have peritonitis?,<noinput>,"If you suspect you have peritonitis, it is important to seek urgent medical advice.

4,How does peritonitis affect kidney dialysis treatment?,<noinput>,"If you're undergoing kidney dialysis treatment and have peritonitis, your doctor might discuss alternative methods until the infection is treated. The fluid in the collection bag during dialysis might appear cloudier than usual or contain white flecks."
5,What is the treatment for pus-filled swellings (abscesses) in the lining caused by peritonitis?,<noinput>,"Pus-filled swellings in the lining caused by peritonitis may require drainage with a needle under local anesthesia. In some cases, surgery may be needed to remove the cause of peritonitis, such as a burst appendix."
6,How is peritonitis diagnosed?,<noinput>,"The diagnosis of peritonitis is usually made based on the symptoms, physical examination, and medical history. Additional tests such as blood tests, imaging studies, and analysis of fluid samples may be done to confirm the diagnosis and identify the underlying cause."
7,Can peritonitis be life-threatening?,<noinput>,"Yes, peritonitis can be life-threatening if left untreated. It is important to seek medical attention if you suspect you have peritonitis to prevent serious complications."
8,What are the risk factors for developing peritonitis?,<noinput>,"Risk factors for developing peritonitis include a history of abdominal surgery, gastrointestinal disorders, kidney failure requiring peritoneal dialysis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and liver disease."
9,Is peritonitis contagious?,<noinput>,"No, peritonitis is not contagious. It is caused by infections in the peritoneum lining and cannot be transmitted from person to person."
