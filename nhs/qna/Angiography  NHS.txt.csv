0,What is angiography?,<noinput>,Angiography is a type of X-ray used to check blood vessels. It involves injecting a contrast agent into the blood vessels to highlight any problems.
1,Why is angiography used?,<noinput>,"Angiography is used to check the health of blood vessels and to diagnose or investigate various conditions such as atherosclerosis, peripheral arterial disease, brain aneurysm, angina, blood clots, and blockages in blood supply to the kidneys. It can also help plan treatment for these conditions."
2,What happens during angiography?,<noinput>,"During angiography, you lie on an X-ray table while a catheter is inserted into your artery. A contrast agent is then injected, and X-rays are taken to observe the flow of the contrast agent through your blood vessels. The procedure can take between 30 minutes and 2 hours."
3,Are there any risks of angiography?,<noinput>,"While generally safe, angiography may cause bruising, soreness, or a small lump near the incision site. There is also a small risk of more serious complications such as an allergic reaction, stroke, or heart attack."
4,What are the different types of angiography?,<noinput>,"Some common types of angiography include coronary angiography (heart and nearby blood vessels), cerebral angiography (blood vessels in and around the brain), pulmonary angiography (blood vessels supplying the lungs), and renal angiography (blood vessels supplying the kidneys). CT angiography and MRI angiography are alternative methods using scans instead of X-rays."
5,What is coronary angiography used for?,<noinput>,Coronary angiography is used to check the heart and nearby blood vessels.
6,What is cerebral angiography used for?,<noinput>,Cerebral angiography is used to check the blood vessels in and around the brain.
7,What is pulmonary angiography used for?,<noinput>,Pulmonary angiography is used to check the blood vessels supplying the lungs.
8,What is renal angiography used for?,<noinput>,Renal angiography is used to check the blood vessels supplying the kidneys.
9,What is fluorescein angiography?,<noinput>,Fluorescein angiography is a type of angiography used to check the eyes. It is not covered in this topic.
0,What is angiography?,<noinput>,"Angiography is a type of X-ray used to check blood vessels by injecting a contrast agent into your blood, highlighting any problems in the blood vessels."
1,Why is angiography used?,<noinput>,"Angiography is used to check the health of blood vessels and diagnose or investigate several problems such as atherosclerosis, peripheral arterial disease, brain aneurysm, angina, blood clots, or blockage in blood supply to the kidneys."
2,What happens during angiography?,<noinput>,"During angiography, you'll be awake but may be given a sedative. A small incision is made near your groin or wrist, and a catheter is inserted into the artery. Contrast agent is injected, and X-rays are taken as it flows through your blood vessels. The test can take 30 minutes to 2 hours."
3,What are the risks of angiography?,<noinput>,"Angiography is generally safe, but you may experience bruising, soreness, or a small lump near the incision site. There's a small risk of allergic reaction to the contrast agent, stroke, or heart attack."
4,What are the different types of angiography?,<noinput>,"There are several types of angiography, including coronary angiography, cerebral angiography, pulmonary angiography, and renal angiography. CT angiography and MRI angiography are done using scans. There's also fluorescein angiography for checking the eyes."
5,How long does angiography take?,<noinput>,Angiography can take between 30 minutes and 2 hours.
6,What can angiography diagnose?,<noinput>,"Angiography can diagnose conditions like atherosclerosis, peripheral arterial disease, brain aneurysm, angina, blood clots, and blockages in blood supply to the kidneys."
7,Where is angiography done?,<noinput>,Angiography is done in a hospital X-ray or radiology department.
8,Are there any complications with angiography?,<noinput>,"Angiography is generally safe, but there's a small risk of complications such as allergic reactions, stroke, or heart attack."
9,Can angiography be done using scans instead of X-rays?,<noinput>,"Yes, angiography can be done using CT angiography or MRI angiography, depending on the part of the body being looked at."
