7,How much radiation is involved in an X-ray?,"During an X-ray, the level of radiation exposure is equivalent to a few days to a few years of natural background radiation. The risk of cancer from an X-ray is extremely low.",The radiation exposure from an X-ray is comparable to natural background radiation encountered over a few days to a few years.

0,How do X-rays work?,<noinput>,"X-rays are a type of radiation that can pass through the body and are absorbed at different rates by different parts of the body. Dense parts like bones appear as clear white areas, while softer parts like the heart and lungs appear as darker areas."
1,What conditions can X-rays help detect?,<noinput>,"X-rays can help detect a range of conditions, including bone fractures and breaks, tooth problems, scoliosis, bone tumours, lung problems, swallowing problems, heart problems, and breast cancer."
2,Do I need to do anything to prepare for an X-ray?,<noinput>,"For most X-rays, you don't need to do anything special. You can eat and drink as normal and take your usual medications.

4,What are contrast X-rays and how do they work?,<noinput>,"Contrast X-rays involve the use of a contrast agent, such as barium or iodine, to help show soft tissues more clearly. These agents are swallowed or injected into the body before the X-ray and help highlight specific areas, such as the upper digestive system or blood vessels."
5,What happens after an X-ray?,<noinput>,"After an X-ray, you can go home and resume your normal activities. There are usually no after effects from a standard X-ray, but if a contrast agent was used, you may experience temporary side effects like changes in bowel movements or blurry vision."
6,Are X-rays safe?,<noinput>,"X-rays are generally safe, with the amount of radiation exposure being low and equivalent to a few days to a few years of exposure to natural radiation. The risk of developing cancer from an X-ray is very small, but it's important to talk to your doctor if you have any concerns."
7,How long does an X-ray take?,<noinput>,"The X-ray procedure itself lasts only a few minutes and is quick. However, X-rays involving a contrast agent may take longer to carry out and may require special preparation beforehand."
