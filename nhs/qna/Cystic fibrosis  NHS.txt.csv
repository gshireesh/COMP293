0,What are the symptoms of cystic fibrosis?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of cystic fibrosis include recurring chest infections, wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, difficulty putting on weight, yellowing of the skin and eyes, diarrhea or constipation, and bowel obstruction in newborn babies."
1,How is cystic fibrosis diagnosed?,<noinput>,"In the UK, newborn babies are screened for cystic fibrosis using the heel prick test. If the screening test suggests cystic fibrosis, additional tests like a sweat test and genetic test are done to confirm the condition."
2,What are the available treatments for cystic fibrosis?,<noinput>,"There's no cure for cystic fibrosis, but treatments can help control symptoms. They include taking different medicines for lung problems, engaging in physical activity, and using airway clearance techniques to clear mucus from the lungs."
3,What complications can occur with cystic fibrosis?,<noinput>,"Complications of cystic fibrosis can include weak and brittle bones, diabetes, nasal polyps and sinus infections, liver problems, and fertility problems."
4,What causes cystic fibrosis?,<noinput>,Cystic fibrosis is caused by a faulty gene that affects the movement of salt and water in and out of cells. It is a genetic condition that is not contagious.
5,What is the outlook for people with cystic fibrosis?,<noinput>,"Cystic fibrosis tends to worsen over time, but advancements in treatment have improved life expectancy. Currently, about half of people with cystic fibrosis live past the age of 40, and children born with the condition today are likely to live longer."
6,What support is available for people with cystic fibrosis?,<noinput>,Support is available to help people with cystic fibrosis live independently. Connecting with charities like Asthma + Lung UK and the Cystic Fibrosis Trust can provide helpful resources and a community of others with the condition.
7,Can cystic fibrosis be inherited?,<noinput>,"Yes, cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition. To be born with cystic fibrosis, a child has to inherit a copy of the faulty gene from both parents. If only one parent has cystic fibrosis, there's a 50% chance their child will be a carrier."
8,Can cystic fibrosis be diagnosed in older children and adults?,<noinput>,"Yes, older children and adults who didn't have the newborn screening test can also be diagnosed with cystic fibrosis through the sweat test and genetic test."
9,Is there a cure for cystic fibrosis?,<noinput>,"No, there is currently no cure for cystic fibrosis. However, treatments are available to manage symptoms and improve quality of life."
0,What are the symptoms of cystic fibrosis?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of cystic fibrosis include recurring chest infections, wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, difficulty putting on weight and growing, yellowing of the skin and eyes, diarrhea, constipation, and bowel obstruction in newborn babies."
1,How is cystic fibrosis diagnosed?,"In the UK, all newborn babies are screened for cystic fibrosis as part of the newborn blood spot test. If the screening test suggests a child may have cystic fibrosis, they'll need additional tests including a sweat test and a genetic test.","Cystic fibrosis is diagnosed through newborn screening, sweat test, and genetic test."
2,What are the treatments for cystic fibrosis?,<noinput>,"Although there is no cure for cystic fibrosis, there are treatments available to control the symptoms and make the condition easier to live with. These treatments include taking different medicines for lung problems, physical activity, and airway clearance techniques."
3,What are the complications of cystic fibrosis?,<noinput>,"Complications of cystic fibrosis can include weak and brittle bones, diabetes, nasal polyps and sinus infections, liver problems, and fertility problems."
4,What causes cystic fibrosis?,<noinput>,"Cystic fibrosis is caused by a faulty gene that affects the movement of salt and water in and out of cells, leading to a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the body's tubes and passageways."
5,What is the outlook for people with cystic fibrosis?,<noinput>,"Cystic fibrosis tends to get worse over time but advancements in treatment have improved life expectancy. Currently, about half of people with cystic fibrosis live past the age of 40."
6,Where can I find support for cystic fibrosis?,<noinput>,"Support for cystic fibrosis is available through organizations such as Asthma + Lung UK, Cystic Fibrosis Trust, CF Kids, and Cystic Fibrosis Care. These organizations provide practical help, support, and information about ongoing research."
7,What is the UK Cystic Fibrosis Registry?,<noinput>,The UK Cystic Fibrosis Registry is a secure anonymous registry sponsored by the Cystic Fibrosis Trust. It records health information on people with cystic fibrosis to help scientists find better ways to prevent and treat the condition.
8,How is cystic fibrosis inherited?,<noinput>,"To be born with cystic fibrosis, a child has to inherit a copy of the faulty gene from both parents. If both parents are carriers, there's a 1 in 4 chance their child will have cystic fibrosis. If one parent has cystic fibrosis and the other is a carrier, there's a 1 in 2 chance their child will have cystic fibrosis."
9,Where can I find more information about cystic fibrosis?,<noinput>,"You can find more information about cystic fibrosis from the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, which provides resources, support, and information about genetic testing and ongoing research."
