1,What causes coronary heart disease?,<noinput>,"Coronary heart disease occurs when your heart's blood supply is blocked or interrupted by a build-up of fatty substances in the coronary arteries.

2,How is coronary heart disease diagnosed?,<noinput>,"If a doctor suspects coronary heart disease, they may perform a risk assessment by evaluating your medical and family history, lifestyle, and taking a blood test. Further tests like a treadmill test, radionuclide scan, CT scan, MRI scan, or coronary angiography may be done to confirm the diagnosis."
3,What are the treatment options for coronary heart disease?,<noinput>,"Coronary heart disease cannot be cured, but treatment can help manage symptoms and reduce the risk of complications such as heart attacks. Treatment options may include lifestyle changes (exercise, quitting smoking), medications, angioplasty (using balloons and stents to treat narrow heart arteries), or surgery."
4,How can someone recover from the effects of coronary heart disease?,<noinput>,"After a heart attack, angioplasty, or heart surgery, it's possible to get back to a normal life. Advice and support are available to help individuals deal with any aspects of life that may have been affected by coronary heart disease."
5,What can be done to prevent coronary heart disease?,<noinput>,"Reducing the risk of coronary heart disease can be achieved through simple lifestyle changes, such as maintaining a healthy, balanced diet, staying physically active, quitting smoking, and managing blood cholesterol and sugar levels. Keeping the heart healthy also has additional health benefits, like reducing the risk of stroke and dementia."
6,What is the function of the heart?,<noinput>,"The heart is a muscular organ about the size of a fist. It pumps blood throughout the body, beating approximately 70 times per minute. After the blood leaves the right side of the heart, it goes to the lungs to pick up oxygen. The oxygen-rich blood then returns to the heart and is pumped to the body's organs through a network of arteries. The blood returns to the heart through veins before being pumped back to the lungs. This process is called circulation."
7,Can you provide information about coronary arteries and heart disease?,<noinput>,"Coronary arteries are the blood vessels that supply oxygen-rich blood to the heart. When these arteries stop functioning properly, it can lead to heart disease. You can watch a video that explains how the heart works and what happens when coronary arteries are affected."
8,What can be done to reduce the risk of stroke and dementia?,<noinput>,"Keeping the heart healthy through lifestyle changes like maintaining a balanced diet, staying physically active, quitting smoking, and controlling blood cholesterol and sugar levels can help reduce the risk of not just coronary heart disease, but also stroke and dementia."
9,How often does the heart beat?,<noinput>,The heart beats approximately 70 times per minute.
