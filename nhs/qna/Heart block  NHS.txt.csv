2,What are the symptoms of 2nd-degree heart block?,<noinput>,"Most people with the less serious type of 2nd-degree heart block, known as Mobitz type 1, do not have any symptoms. However, some people may feel lightheaded or dizzy, or faint.

4,What causes heart block?,<noinput>,"Heart block can be caused by other heart conditions such as a heart attack, some prescription medicines, other conditions like Lyme disease, or having heart surgery. Some people are born with heart block, known as congenital heart block."
5,How is heart block treated?,<noinput>,"Heart block normally only needs to be treated if it's causing symptoms. Depending on the cause and symptoms, a small device called a pacemaker may need to be fitted in your chest. A pacemaker sends frequent electrical pulses to keep your heart beating regularly."
6,What is a pacemaker?,<noinput>,A pacemaker is a small battery-operated device inserted under the skin of your chest. It sends frequent electrical pulses to keep your heart beating regularly.
7,Can heart block be diagnosed without symptoms?,<noinput>,"Heart block is often diagnosed during routine tests for other conditions. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is the main test used to diagnose heart block, and it measures the electrical activity of your heart. The results of an ECG can sometimes indicate the type of heart block you have."
8,How is heart block diagnosed?,<noinput>,An electrocardiogram (ECG) is the main test used to diagnose heart block. It measures the electrical activity of your heart. Your doctor may ask you to wear a portable ECG monitor to get a reading over time. It provides a useful overall assessment of how well your heart is working.
9,Can heart block be diagnosed during exercise?,<noinput>,"Yes, an electrocardiogram (ECG) can be carried out while you're exercising to diagnose heart block. It provides a useful overall assessment of how well your heart is working."

8,Can heart block be life threatening?,<noinput>,Severe symptoms of heart block can be life threatening and require immediate medical attention.
9,Can heart block be detected without symptoms?,<noinput>,"Heart block can be detected without symptoms during routine tests for other conditions, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG)."
