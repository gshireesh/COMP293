0,What is alkaptonuria?,<noinput>,"Alkaptonuria is a rare inherited disorder that causes the body to have difficulty breaking down certain amino acids, resulting in a build-up of a chemical called homogentisic acid, which can lead to various health problems."
1,What are the symptoms of alkaptonuria in adults?,<noinput>,"In adults, symptoms of alkaptonuria can include joint pain and stiffness, brown or black spots on the whites of the eyes, thickened ear cartilage, discolored sweat and nails, breathing difficulties, and heart, kidney, and prostate problems."
2,How is alkaptonuria inherited?,<noinput>,"Alkaptonuria is inherited when a person receives two copies of the faulty HGD gene, one from each parent. The chances of inheriting the condition are slim, which is why it is very rare."
3,How is alkaptonuria managed?,<noinput>,"Alkaptonuria is managed through lifelong treatment with a medicine called nitisinone, which helps reduce the level of homogentisic acid in the body. Painkillers, protein-controlled diet, exercising, pain relief techniques, emotional support, and surgery may also be part of the management approach."
4,What is nitisinone?,<noinput>,Nitisinone is a medicine used to reduce the level of homogentisic acid in the body of individuals with alkaptonuria. It is offered at the National Alkaptonuria Centre and can help slow down the progression of the condition.
5,How can a protein-controlled diet help in managing alkaptonuria?,<noinput>,A protein-controlled diet can be useful in reducing the risk of potential side effects when taking nitisinone for alkaptonuria during adulthood. A doctor or dietitian can assess and advise on the appropriate diet for an individual.
6,What role does exercise play in managing alkaptonuria?,<noinput>,"Regular gentle exercise can help manage alkaptonuria symptoms by building muscle, strengthening joints, relieving stress, aiding weight loss, and improving posture. However, high-impact exercises should be avoided to prevent joint damage."
7,How can pain relief be managed in alkaptonuria?,<noinput>,Painkillers and other pain management techniques can be used to alleviate pain in individuals with alkaptonuria. It is important to consult with a doctor to find suitable options.
8,Where can I find emotional support for alkaptonuria?,<noinput>,"GPs and organizations such as the AKU Society can provide support and resources for individuals with alkaptonuria and their families, helping them cope with the emotional impact of the condition."
9,What is the outlook for people with alkaptonuria?,<noinput>,"People with alkaptonuria have a normal life expectancy. However, they may experience symptoms that can affect their quality of life, such as joint and spinal pain and loss of movement."
0,What is alkaptonuria?,<noinput>,"Alkaptonuria, or black urine disease, is a rare inherited disorder that prevents the body from fully breaking down certain amino acids, leading to a build-up of homogentisic acid in the body. This can cause urine and parts of the body to turn dark and can lead to various health problems over time."
1,What are the signs and symptoms of alkaptonuria in adults?,<noinput>,"In adults, alkaptonuria can result in joint problems, such as lower back pain and stiffness, and can lead to knee, hip, and shoulder pain. It can also cause brown or black spots on the whites of the eyes, thickening of ear cartilage, discolored sweat and skin, breathing difficulties, and heart, kidney, and prostate problems."
2,How is alkaptonuria inherited?,<noinput>,"Alkaptonuria is inherited when a person inherits two copies of the faulty HGD gene (one from each parent). The chances of this happening are slim, which is why the condition is very rare. However, the parents of a person with alkaptonuria may carry only one copy of the faulty gene without showing any signs or symptoms of the condition."
3,How is alkaptonuria managed?,<noinput>,"Alkaptonuria is managed through lifelong treatment and lifestyle changes. A medicine called nitisinone is used to slow the progression of the condition in adults. Painkillers and a protein-controlled diet may also be recommended. Regular gentle exercise, pain relief techniques, and emotional support can also be helpful. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to replace damaged joints or heart valves."
4,What is the outlook for people with alkaptonuria?,<noinput>,"People with alkaptonuria have a normal life expectancy.

Over time, working and engaging in strenuous physical activity may become difficult, and the use of mobility aids, like wheelchairs, may be necessary."
5,How can exercise help manage alkaptonuria?,<noinput>,"Regular gentle exercise can help manage alkaptonuria by building muscle, strengthening joints, relieving stress, aiding weight loss, and improving posture.

8,What information is shared if someone has alkaptonuria?,<noinput>,"If someone has alkaptonuria, relevant patient information is shared with the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists gather data for research and improving prevention and treatment methods. However, individuals can choose to opt out of the register at any time."
