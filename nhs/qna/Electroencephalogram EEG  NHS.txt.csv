0,What is an electroencephalogram (EEG)?,<noinput>,"An EEG is a recording of brain activity. Small sensors are attached to the scalp to pick up the electrical signals produced by the brain, which are then recorded and analyzed by a doctor."
1,What conditions can an EEG help diagnose and monitor?,<noinput>,"An EEG can help diagnose and monitor conditions such as epilepsy, seizures, memory problems, dementia, head injuries, brain tumors, encephalitis, and sleep disorders."
2,How should I prepare for an EEG?,<noinput>,"To prepare for an EEG, make sure your hair is clean and dry. Avoid using hair gel and wax. You can usually eat and drink normally before the test and continue to take your regular medication."
3,What happens during an EEG?,<noinput>,"During an EEG, electrodes are attached to your scalp using a special glue or paste. These electrodes are connected to an EEG recording machine. You'll be asked to sit or lie down while the recording is being taken."
4,How long does a routine EEG recording usually take?,<noinput>,"A routine EEG recording usually takes about 20 to 40 minutes. The whole appointment, including preparation time, may last about an hour."
5,What are the different types of EEG recordings?,<noinput>,"The different types of EEG recordings include routine EEG, sleep EEG or sleep-deprived EEG, ambulatory EEG, video telemetry, and invasive EEG-telemetry."
6,What happens after an EEG?,<noinput>,"After an EEG, the electrodes will be removed and your scalp will be cleaned. Your hair may still be sticky and messy, so you may want to wash it when you get home. Results will be analyzed and sent to your doctor for discussion."
7,Are there any risks or side effects of an EEG?,<noinput>,"An EEG is generally safe and comfortable, with no electricity being put into your body. You may feel lightheaded and experience a mild tingling sensation during the test. Some people develop a mild rash where the electrodes were attached."
8,What does an ambulatory EEG involve?,<noinput>,An ambulatory EEG involves recording brain activity throughout the day and night over a period of one or more days. Electrodes are attached to a portable EEG recorder that can be clipped onto your clothing.
9,How is video telemetry EEG carried out?,<noinput>,Video telemetry EEG involves filming you while an EEG recording is taken. It provides more information about your brain activity. The test is usually carried out over a few days in a purpose-built hospital suite.
0,What is an electroencephalogram (EEG)?,<noinput>,An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a recording of brain activity using small sensors attached to the scalp to pick up the electrical signals produced by the brain.
1,How is an EEG used?,<noinput>,"An EEG can be used to help diagnose and monitor conditions affecting the brain, such as epilepsy, memory problems, and sleep disorders."
2,How should I prepare for an EEG?,<noinput>,"To prepare for an EEG, make sure your hair is clean and dry, avoid using hair products, and bring a hairbrush or comb to tidy up afterwards."
3,What happens during an EEG procedure?,<noinput>,"During an EEG, small sensors called electrodes are attached to your scalp and connected to an EEG recording machine. You will sit or lie down while the recording takes place."
4,How long does a routine EEG recording usually take?,<noinput>,"A routine EEG recording usually takes 20 to 40 minutes, with an overall appointment time of about an hour."
5,What are the different types of EEG?,<noinput>,"The different types of EEG include routine EEG, sleep EEG, ambulatory EEG, video telemetry, and invasive EEG-telemetry."
6,What happens after an EEG?,<noinput>,"After an EEG, the electrodes are removed, and your scalp will be cleaned. You can go home and resume your normal activities."
7,Are there any risks or side effects of an EEG?,<noinput>,"An EEG is generally safe with no risks or side effects. Some people may experience lightheadedness, tingling sensations, or mild skin rash."
8,When will I receive the results of my EEG?,<noinput>,The results of your EEG will be analyzed and sent to the doctor who requested the test. They will discuss the results with you in a few days or weeks.
9,What are the benefits of participating in EEG research?,<noinput>,Participating in EEG research can contribute to advancements in understanding and treating epilepsy.
