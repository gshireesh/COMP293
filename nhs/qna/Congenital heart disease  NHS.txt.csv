0,What is congenital heart disease?,<noinput>,"Congenital heart disease refers to a range of birth defects that affect the way the heart works. This condition is present from birth and is one of the most common types of birth defects, affecting around 1 in 100 babies born in the UK."
1,What are some known risk factors for congenital heart disease?,<noinput>,"Some known risk factors for congenital heart disease include Down's syndrome, certain infections during pregnancy (such as rubella), certain medications taken during pregnancy (like statins and some acne medications), smoking and drinking alcohol during pregnancy, poorly controlled diabetes, and other chromosome defects."
2,What are the symptoms of congenital heart disease?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of congenital heart disease can include rapid heartbeat, rapid breathing, swelling of the legs or around the eyes, extreme tiredness and fatigue, cyanosis (a blue tinge to the skin or lips), and tiredness and rapid breathing when a baby is feeding."
3,What are some common types of congenital heart disease?,<noinput>,"Some common types of congenital heart disease include septal defects (also known as 'holes in the heart'), coarctation of the aorta, pulmonary valve stenosis, transposition of the great arteries, and underdeveloped heart."
4,How is congenital heart disease usually treated?,<noinput>,"The treatment for congenital heart disease depends on the specific defect. Mild defects may not require treatment and can improve on their own. However, more significant defects may require surgery or interventional procedures. Treatment often continues throughout a person's life, as further heart problems can develop over time."
5,What is the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service?,<noinput>,The National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) collects information on individuals with congenital heart disease to help researchers find better ways to prevent and treat the condition. It is possible to opt out of the register at any time.
6,How is the heart divided?,<noinput>,"The heart is divided into four main sections called chambers: the left atrium, left ventricle, right atrium, and right ventricle. Each chamber has a specific function in circulating blood throughout the body."
7,What are the valves in the heart called?,<noinput>,"There are four valves in the heart: the mitral valve, aortic valve, tricuspid valve, and pulmonary valve. These valves control the flow of blood between the different chambers of the heart and out to the rest of the body or to the lungs."
8,Can congenital heart disease occur if the chambers or valves of the heart don't develop properly?,<noinput>,"Yes, congenital heart disease can occur if any of the chambers or valves of the heart do not develop properly during fetal development."
0,What is the cause of congenital heart disease?,<noinput>,"In most cases, no obvious cause of congenital heart disease is identified. However, there are known risk factors such as Down's syndrome, certain infections during pregnancy, certain medications taken during pregnancy, smoking or drinking alcohol during pregnancy, poorly controlled diabetes, and genetic defects."
1,What are the symptoms of congenital heart disease?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of congenital heart disease can include rapid heartbeat, rapid breathing, swelling of the legs or eyes, extreme tiredness, a blue tinge to the skin or lips, and tiredness and rapid breathing when feeding."
2,What are some common types of congenital heart disease?,<noinput>,"Some common types of congenital heart disease include septal defects (holes in the heart), coarctation of the aorta (narrowing of the main artery), pulmonary valve stenosis (narrowing of the pulmonary valve), transposition of the great arteries, and underdeveloped heart."
3,How is congenital heart disease treated?,<noinput>,"Treatment for congenital heart disease depends on the specific defect. Mild defects may not require treatment, while significant defects may require surgery or interventional procedures. Regular specialist review and lifelong treatment may be necessary."
4,What is the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service?,<noinput>,The National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) collects information about individuals with congenital heart disease to help researchers find better prevention and treatment methods. Opting out of the register is possible.
5,How is the heart divided?,<noinput>,"The heart is divided into four chambers: the left atrium, left ventricle, right atrium, and right ventricle. It also has four valves: the mitral valve, aortic valve, tricuspid valve, and pulmonary valve."
6,What happens if a chamber or valve doesn't develop properly while a baby is in the womb?,<noinput>,Congenital heart disease can occur if any of the heart's chambers or valves do not develop properly during fetal development.
7,What are the known risk factors for congenital heart disease?,<noinput>,"Known risk factors for congenital heart disease include Down's syndrome, certain infections during pregnancy, certain medications taken during pregnancy, smoking or drinking alcohol during pregnancy, poorly controlled diabetes, and genetic defects."
8,Are all cases of congenital heart disease diagnosed before birth?,<noinput>,"Many cases of congenital heart disease are diagnosed before birth through ultrasound scans, but some defects may not be detectable until later in life."
9,Does mild congenital heart disease always need treatment?,<noinput>,"Mild defects, such as holes in the heart, may not require treatment as they can improve on their own and may not cause further problems."
0,What is congenital heart disease?,<noinput>,Congenital heart disease is a term used to describe a range of birth defects that affect the normal functioning of the heart. These defects are present from birth and can vary in severity.
1,What are some causes of congenital heart disease?,<noinput>,"The exact cause of congenital heart disease is often unknown, but there are certain factors that can increase the risk. These include genetic disorders, certain infections during pregnancy, exposure to certain medications, smoking or drinking alcohol during pregnancy, and poorly controlled diabetes."
2,What are the symptoms of congenital heart disease in babies and children?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of congenital heart disease in babies and children can include rapid heartbeat, rapid breathing, swelling of the legs or tummy, extreme tiredness and fatigue, a blue tinge to the skin or lips, and tiredness and rapid breathing during feeding."
3,What are some common types of congenital heart disease?,<noinput>,"Some common types of congenital heart disease include septal defects (holes in the heart), coarctation of the aorta (narrowing of the main artery), pulmonary valve stenosis (narrowing of the pulmonary valve), transposition of the great arteries, and underdeveloped heart."
4,How is congenital heart disease treated?,<noinput>,"Treatment for congenital heart disease depends on the specific defect and its severity. Mild defects may not require treatment, while significant defects may require surgery or interventional procedures. Treatment may be lifelong and may include regular specialist reviews."
5,What is the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service?,<noinput>,The National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) collects information about individuals with congenital heart disease to help researchers find better ways to prevent and treat the condition.
6,What are the main sections of the heart?,<noinput>,"The heart is divided into four main sections called chambers: the left atrium, left ventricle, right atrium, and right ventricle. Each chamber has a specific function in pumping and collecting blood."
7,What are the four valves in the heart and what do they do?,<noinput>,"The heart has four valves: the mitral valve, aortic valve, tricuspid valve, and pulmonary valve. These valves control the flow of blood through the heart and prevent backflow. Each valve is located between specific chambers or arteries."
8,How does congenital heart disease occur?,<noinput>,Congenital heart disease can occur if any of the chambers or valves in the heart do not develop properly during fetal development. This can affect the normal functioning of the heart.
9,Can congenital heart disease improve or go away on its own?,<noinput>,"Mild defects, such as small holes in the heart, may improve on their own and not cause further problems. However, significant defects usually require treatment and may require lifelong management."
