0,What are the symptoms of lung cancer?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of lung cancer include a persistent cough, coughing up blood, persistent breathlessness, unexplained tiredness and weight loss, and an ache or pain when breathing or coughing."
1,What are the two main forms of primary lung cancer?,<noinput>,"The two main forms of primary lung cancer are non-small-cell lung cancer (including squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large-cell carcinoma) and small-cell lung cancer."
2,Who is most affected by lung cancer?,<noinput>,Lung cancer mainly affects older people and is rare in people younger than 40. More than 4 out of 10 people diagnosed with lung cancer in the UK are aged 75 and older. Smoking is the most common cause of lung cancer.
3,What are the treatment options for lung cancer?,<noinput>,"The treatment for lung cancer depends on the type of mutation, the spread of the cancer, and the patient's general health. Treatment options may include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapies."
4,Can surgery be used to treat lung cancer?,<noinput>,Surgery may be recommended to remove the affected area of lung if the cancer is diagnosed early and the cancerous cells are confined to a small area.
5,What is radiotherapy and when is it recommended for lung cancer?,<noinput>,Radiotherapy is a treatment option for lung cancer in which radiation is used to destroy the cancerous cells. It may be recommended if surgery is unsuitable or ineffective.
6,What is chemotherapy and when is it used for lung cancer?,<noinput>,Chemotherapy is a treatment for lung cancer that uses drugs to destroy cancer cells. It is usually used when the cancer has spread too far for surgery or radiotherapy to be effective.
7,What are targeted therapies for lung cancer?,<noinput>,Targeted therapies are a type of treatment that target specific changes in or around cancer cells that help them grow. They cannot cure lung cancer but can slow its spread.
8,What is the outlook for lung cancer?,<noinput>,"The outlook for lung cancer is not as good as many other types of cancer. About 2 in 5 people with the condition live for at least 1 year after diagnosis, and about 1 in 10 live at least 10 years. Early diagnosis can make a big difference."
9,How does smoking contribute to lung cancer?,<noinput>,"Smoking is the most common cause of lung cancer, accounting for more than 70 out of 100 cases. Regularly inhaling toxic substances through smoking increases the risk of developing lung cancer."

3,What are the treatment options for lung cancer?,<noinput>,"The treatment for lung cancer depends on factors such as the type of mutation, spread of the cancer, and overall health. Treatment options include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapies."
4,Can targeted therapies cure lung cancer?,<noinput>,"Targeted therapies cannot cure lung cancer, but they can slow down its spread by targeting specific changes in or around the cancer cells."
5,When do symptoms of lung cancer usually become noticeable?,<noinput>,Symptoms of lung cancer usually become noticeable when it has spread through the lungs or into other parts of the body. Early diagnosis can improve the outlook.

About 2 in 5 people with the condition live for at least 1 year after diagnosis, and about 1 in 10 people live at least 10 years. However, survival rates vary depending on the stage of cancer at the time of diagnosis."
8,How many people are diagnosed with lung cancer every year in the UK?,<noinput>,"More than 43,000 people are diagnosed with lung cancer every year in the UK."
