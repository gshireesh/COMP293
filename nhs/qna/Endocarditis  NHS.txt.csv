0,What is endocarditis?,<noinput>,Endocarditis is a rare and potentially fatal infection of the inner lining of the heart. It is most commonly caused by bacteria entering the blood and traveling to the heart.
1,What are the symptoms of endocarditis?,<noinput>,"The initial symptoms of endocarditis are similar to flu, including a high temperature, chills, headache, joint and muscle pain. Without treatment, it can lead to life-threatening complications such as heart failure and stroke."
2,How is endocarditis treated?,<noinput>,Endocarditis is treated with a course of antibiotics given via a drip. Some people may also need surgery to repair or replace a damaged heart valve or drain abscesses.
3,Who is affected by endocarditis?,<noinput>,"Endocarditis is a rare condition that is more common in older people. However, cases have been recorded in children, especially those born with congenital heart disease. Twice as many men are affected compared to women."
4,What causes endocarditis?,<noinput>,"Endocarditis is most commonly caused by bacteria entering the blood and reaching the heart. People with factors like artificial heart valves, congenital heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, damaged heart valves, or a history of endocarditis are at higher risk."
5,How does endocarditis damage the heart?,<noinput>,Endocarditis damages the heart valves and disrupts the normal flow of blood through the heart. This can lead to life-threatening complications such as heart failure and stroke.
6,What is the outlook for endocarditis?,<noinput>,"Early diagnosis and treatment are vital to improve the outlook for endocarditis. If complications develop, it can be a serious illness. The condition is relatively rare in England."
7,How is endocarditis diagnosed?,<noinput>,"Endocarditis is diagnosed through a combination of clinical evaluation, blood tests, and imaging studies such as echocardiography. Doctors may also perform a physical examination and review the patient's medical history."
8,Can endocarditis be prevented?,<noinput>,"Endocarditis can sometimes be prevented by maintaining good oral hygiene, taking antibiotics before certain dental procedures if advised, and managing conditions like heart disease or artificial heart valves. It's important to follow medical advice and seek prompt treatment for any signs of infection."
9,Why are rates of endocarditis increasing?,<noinput>,"Rates of endocarditis are increasing due to advances in medical care, such as more people undergoing valve replacement surgery or surgery to repair congenital heart disease."

4,Why is early diagnosis and treatment important for endocarditis?,<noinput>,Early diagnosis and treatment of endocarditis is vital to improve the outlook for the condition and to prevent serious complications from developing.
5,Who is at a higher risk of developing endocarditis?,<noinput>,"People with artificial heart valves, congenital heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, damaged heart valves, a history of endocarditis, or those who inject drugs are at a higher risk of developing endocarditis."
6,Is endocarditis more common in older people?,<noinput>,"Yes, endocarditis is more common in older people. However, cases have been recorded in children, particularly those born with congenital heart disease."
7,Are rates of endocarditis increasing?,<noinput>,"Yes, rates of endocarditis are increasing due to advances in medical care and an increasing number of people being treated with valve replacement surgery or surgery for congenital heart disease."
8,What are the potential complications of endocarditis?,<noinput>,"If left untreated, endocarditis can lead to complications such as heart failure, where the heart is unable to pump enough blood, and stroke, where the blood supply to the brain is disrupted."
9,How is endocarditis diagnosed?,<noinput>,"Endocarditis is diagnosed through a combination of medical history, physical examination, blood tests, and imaging tests like echocardiogram or MRI."
