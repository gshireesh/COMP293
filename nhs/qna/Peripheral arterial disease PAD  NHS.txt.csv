0,What are the symptoms of peripheral arterial disease?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of peripheral arterial disease can include leg pain, hair loss on legs and feet, numbness or weakness in the legs, ulcers on feet and legs, changing skin color on legs, shiny skin, and erectile dysfunction in men."
1,When should I see a GP for peripheral arterial disease?,<noinput>,You should see a GP if you experience recurring leg pain when exercising. Do not dismiss it as a normal part of aging. A GP can diagnose PAD through a physical examination and comparing the blood pressure in your arm and ankle.
2,What are the causes of peripheral arterial disease?,<noinput>,"PAD is caused by a build-up of fatty deposits in the leg arteries. Risk factors include smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and growing older."
3,How is peripheral arterial disease treated?,<noinput>,"PAD is mainly treated through lifestyle changes and medication. It is important to exercise regularly, quit smoking, eat a healthy diet, and manage high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes. Medication and surgery can also be used to improve blood flow."
4,Are there complications associated with peripheral arterial disease?,<noinput>,"While PAD is not immediately life-threatening, it can lead to serious complications such as coronary heart disease, stroke, heart attack, angina, and critical limb ischaemia (CLI). CLI is a severe complication that can cause burning leg pain, skin changes, ulcers, and potential limb amputation."
5,What are the symptoms of critical limb ischaemia (CLI)?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of CLI include severe burning leg pain, pale and shiny skin, non-healing wounds and ulcers on feet and legs, loss of muscle mass, cold and numb toes or limbs, skin discoloration, swelling, and gangrene. If you experience these symptoms, seek immediate medical attention."
6,What treatments are available for critical limb ischaemia (CLI)?,<noinput>,"For CLI, treatments such as angioplasty or bypass graft may be recommended. However, these may not always be successful or possible. In some cases, amputation below the knee may be required."
7,How can I reduce the risk of peripheral arterial disease?,<noinput>,"To reduce the risk of PAD, it is important to quit smoking, manage diabetes, control high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels, exercise regularly, eat a healthy diet, and maintain a healthy weight."
8,Can medication improve the symptoms of peripheral arterial disease?,<noinput>,"Medication can be used to improve the symptoms of PAD by increasing blood flow in the legs. Your doctor may prescribe medication such as antiplatelet agents, lipid-lowering drugs, or medication to control blood pressure."
9,Is surgery always necessary for treating peripheral arterial disease?,<noinput>,"Surgery is not always necessary for treating PAD. Lifestyle changes and medication are typically the first line of treatment. Surgery, such as angioplasty or bypass graft, may be considered if lifestyle changes and medication are not enough to improve blood flow."
0,What are the symptoms of peripheral arterial disease?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of peripheral arterial disease include leg pain when walking, hair loss on legs and feet, numbness or weakness in the legs, ulcers on feet and legs, and changing skin color on legs."
1,When should I see a GP for peripheral arterial disease?,<noinput>,"You should see a GP if you experience recurring leg pain when exercising, especially if it worsens or develops quickly."
2,What causes peripheral arterial disease?,<noinput>,"Peripheral arterial disease is caused by a build-up of fatty deposits in the leg arteries, known as atherosclerosis. Factors like smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and aging increase the risk of developing PAD."
3,How is peripheral arterial disease treated?,<noinput>,"PAD is treated through lifestyle changes like exercise, quitting smoking, and maintaining a healthy diet. Medication and surgery may also be used to improve blood flow and treat underlying causes like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes."
4,What are the complications of peripheral arterial disease?,<noinput>,"Complications of PAD include coronary heart disease, stroke, heart attack, angina, and critical limb ischaemia. Critical limb ischaemia can cause severe pain, skin changes, non-healing ulcers, and may require amputation in severe cases."
5,What are the symptoms of critical limb ischaemia?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of critical limb ischaemia include severe burning leg pain, pale and shiny skin, non-healing ulcers, loss of muscle mass in the legs, cold and numb toes or limbs, and changes in skin color."
6,What should I do if I think I have critical limb ischaemia?,<noinput>,"If you suspect you have symptoms of critical limb ischaemia, it is important to contact a GP immediately. If that is not possible, call 111 or use 111 online for assistance."
7,What treatments are recommended for critical limb ischaemia?,<noinput>,"Treatment options for critical limb ischaemia include angioplasty, bypass graft, and in rare cases, amputation below the knee."
8,How does peripheral arterial disease affect the blood flow to the legs?,<noinput>,"Peripheral arterial disease narrows the leg arteries due to the build-up of fatty deposits, restricting blood flow to the legs and causing symptoms like pain, numbness, and ulcers."
9,Can lifestyle changes help in managing peripheral arterial disease?,<noinput>,"Yes, making lifestyle changes like exercising regularly, quitting smoking, maintaining a healthy diet, and moderate alcohol consumption can help manage peripheral arterial disease and improve symptoms."
