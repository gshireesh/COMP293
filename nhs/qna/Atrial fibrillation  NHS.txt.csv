0,What is a normal heart rate?,<noinput>,A normal heart rate should be regular and between 60 and 100 beats a minute when you're resting.
1,How can I measure my heart rate?,<noinput>,You can measure your heart rate by checking your pulse in your wrist or neck.
2,What are the symptoms of atrial fibrillation?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of atrial fibrillation include dizziness, shortness of breath, tiredness, and noticeable heart palpitations."
3,When should I see a GP for atrial fibrillation?,<noinput>,"You should see a GP or call 111 if you have chest pain that comes and goes, notice a sudden change in your heartbeat, or if your heart rate is consistently lower than 60 or above 100."
4,When should I call 999 for atrial fibrillation?,<noinput>,"You should call 999 if you have sudden chest pain that spreads to your arms, back, neck or jaw, makes your chest feel tight or heavy, starts with shortness of breath, sweating and feeling or being sick, or lasts more than 15 minutes."
5,What causes atrial fibrillation?,<noinput>,"Atrial fibrillation is caused by abnormal electrical impulses firing in the heart's upper chambers (atria), overriding the heart's natural pacemaker."
6,Who is affected by atrial fibrillation?,<noinput>,"Atrial fibrillation affects around 1.4 million people in the UK, mainly older people and more men than women. It is more common in people with high blood pressure or heart conditions."
7,How is atrial fibrillation treated?,<noinput>,"Treatment for atrial fibrillation may involve medicines to prevent stroke, control heart rate or rhythm, cardioversion, or catheter ablation."
8,What is atrial flutter?,<noinput>,"Atrial flutter is a less common heart condition that shares symptoms, causes, and possible complications with atrial fibrillation. Treatment for atrial flutter involves catheter ablation."
9,Which treatment is considered best for atrial flutter?,<noinput>,"Catheter ablation is considered the best treatment for atrial flutter, while medicine is often the first treatment used for atrial fibrillation."
0,What are the symptoms of atrial fibrillation?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of atrial fibrillation include irregular and often fast heart rate, dizziness, shortness of breath, tiredness, and palpitations."
1,When should I see a GP for atrial fibrillation?,<noinput>,"You should see a GP or call 111 if you have chest pain, notice a sudden change in your heartbeat, or if your heart rate is consistently lower than 60 or above 100, especially if you're experiencing other symptoms of atrial fibrillation."
2,What should I do if I experience chest pain related to atrial fibrillation?,<noinput>,"If you have sudden chest pain that spreads to your arms, back, neck or jaw, makes your chest feel tight or heavy, and lasts more than 15 minutes, you should call 999 immediately as you could be having a heart attack."
3,What causes atrial fibrillation?,<noinput>,"Atrial fibrillation is caused by abnormal electrical impulses in the heart's upper chambers. The cause is not fully understood, but it tends to affect older people and people with chronic conditions such as heart disease, high blood pressure, or obesity. It can also be triggered by alcohol or smoking."
4,Who is affected by atrial fibrillation?,<noinput>,"Atrial fibrillation affects around 1.4 million people in the UK. It can affect adults of any age, but it's more common in older people and more men than women. It's more likely to occur in people with other conditions such as high blood pressure or a heart valve problem."
5,How is atrial fibrillation treated?,<noinput>,"Treatment for atrial fibrillation may involve medications to prevent stroke, control heart rate, or restore normal rhythm. Other treatments include cardioversion, catheter ablation, or the use of a pacemaker."
6,What is atrial flutter and how is it treated?,<noinput>,"Atrial flutter is less common than atrial fibrillation and has similar symptoms and causes. Treatment for atrial flutter usually involves catheter ablation, whereas medicine is often used as the first treatment for atrial fibrillation."
7,What is the difference between atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter?,<noinput>,"While atrial fibrillation has an irregular and often fast heart rate, atrial flutter has a more organized and less chaotic rhythm in the atria. However, both conditions share similar symptoms, causes, and possible complications."
8,What is paroxysmal atrial fibrillation?,<noinput>,"Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is when episodes of atrial fibrillation come and go, usually stopping within 48 hours without any treatment."
9,What is the best treatment for atrial flutter?,<noinput>,The best treatment for atrial flutter is considered to be catheter ablation.
