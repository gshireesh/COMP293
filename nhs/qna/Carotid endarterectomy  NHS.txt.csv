0,What is carotid endarterectomy?,<noinput>,Carotid endarterectomy is a surgical procedure to remove fatty deposits that cause narrowing of the carotid arteries.
1,What are the risks associated with carotid endarterectomy?,<noinput>,"The risks of carotid endarterectomy include temporary numbness or discomfort in the neck, as well as a small risk of stroke or death in 2 to 3% of cases."
2,How long does it usually take to recover after a carotid endarterectomy?,<noinput>,Most people are well enough to go home within about 48 hours after the procedure.
3,What are the symptoms that may indicate a narrowed carotid artery?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of a narrowed carotid artery can include numbness or weakness in the face, arm or leg, speech problems, and loss of vision in one eye."
4,What is the alternative procedure to carotid endarterectomy?,<noinput>,"The alternative procedure to carotid endarterectomy is carotid artery stent placement, which involves placing a mesh cylinder (stent) into the narrowed section of the artery to widen it."
5,When should a carotid endarterectomy be performed?,<noinput>,A carotid endarterectomy should be performed as soon as possible after symptoms appear.
6,What are the advantages and disadvantages of local anesthesia for carotid endarterectomy?,<noinput>,"The advantage of local anesthesia for carotid endarterectomy is that it allows the surgeon to monitor brain function while the patient is awake. However, there is no evidence that either local or general anesthesia is safer or better."
7,What is the main reason for performing carotid endarterectomy?,<noinput>,"The main reason for performing carotid endarterectomy is to reduce the risk of stroke, especially in people with severely narrowed carotid arteries or those who have previously had a stroke or a TIA."
8,What are the complications of carotid endarterectomy?,<noinput>,"The complications of carotid endarterectomy can include temporary numbness or discomfort in the neck, as well as a small risk of stroke or death in 2 to 3% of cases. However, this risk is lower than in people with carotid artery disease who have not undergone the operation."
9,Who may be considered high risk for carotid endarterectomy?,<noinput>,"Some people with other medical problems may be considered high risk for carotid endarterectomy. In such cases, carotid artery stent placement can be an important alternative."
0,What is carotid endarterectomy?,<noinput>,"Carotid endarterectomy is a surgical procedure to remove fatty deposits that cause narrowing of the carotid arteries, which supply blood to the neck, face, and brain."
1,Why is carotid endarterectomy performed?,<noinput>,"Carotid endarterectomy is performed when one or both carotid arteries become narrowed due to a build-up of plaque, which can lead to carotid artery disease or carotid artery stenosis."
2,What are the risks of leaving a narrowed carotid artery untreated?,<noinput>,"If a narrowed carotid artery is left untreated, it can lead to a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), which can cause brain damage or death."
3,How can a carotid endarterectomy reduce the risk of stroke?,<noinput>,"A carotid endarterectomy can significantly reduce the risk of stroke in people with severely narrowed carotid arteries, especially in those who have previously had a stroke or TIA."
4,What type of anesthesia is used for carotid endarterectomy?,<noinput>,Carotid endarterectomy can be carried out using either local anesthesia or general anesthesia.
5,What happens during a carotid endarterectomy procedure?,<noinput>,"During a carotid endarterectomy, a cut is made on the side of the neck, and then a small cut is made along the narrowed section of the artery to remove the fatty deposits. The artery is closed with stitches or a patch, and the skin is closed with stitches."
6,What can be expected after a carotid endarterectomy?,<noinput>,"After a carotid endarterectomy, most people are well enough to go home within about 48 hours. Temporary numbness or discomfort in the neck may be experienced, and there is a small risk of more serious complications."
7,Are there any alternatives to carotid endarterectomy?,<noinput>,Carotid artery stent placement may be an alternative to carotid endarterectomy. It is a less invasive procedure that involves placing a mesh cylinder (stent) into the narrowed section of the artery through a small cut in the groin.
8,When is carotid artery stent placement considered as an alternative?,<noinput>,Carotid artery stent placement is considered as an alternative for some people who may be considered high risk for carotid endarterectomy due to other medical problems.
9,Which treatment is recommended as the first line for narrowing of the carotid arteries?,<noinput>,"Carotid endarterectomy is recommended as the first line of treatment for most people with narrowing of the carotid arteries, as it is associated with a lower risk of stroke during the procedure compared to carotid artery stent placement."
