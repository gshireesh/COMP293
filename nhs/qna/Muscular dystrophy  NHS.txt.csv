0,What causes muscular dystrophy?,<noinput>,"Muscular dystrophy is caused by mutations in genes responsible for muscle structure and function. These mutations interfere with muscle fiber function, leading to increasing disability. In many cases, the mutations are inherited from parents."
1,What are the different types of muscular dystrophy?,<noinput>,"There are many different types of muscular dystrophy, including Duchenne MD, myotonic dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral MD, Becker MD, limb-girdle MD, oculopharyngeal MD, and Emery-Dreifuss MD."
2,Who is affected by muscular dystrophy?,<noinput>,"Approximately 70,000 people in the UK have muscular dystrophy or a related condition. Duchenne MD is the most common type, affecting about 100 boys born each year in the UK."
3,How is muscular dystrophy diagnosed?,<noinput>,"Diagnosis of muscular dystrophy involves investigating symptoms, discussing family history, physical examination, blood tests, electrical tests on nerves and muscles, and potentially a muscle biopsy. It's important to see a GP if symptoms are present."
4,Are there any treatments available for muscular dystrophy?,<noinput>,"While there is no cure for muscular dystrophy, there are treatments to manage physical disabilities and related problems. These can include exercise, physiotherapy, support groups, surgery, and medications like steroids or ACE inhibitors."
5,Are there support groups available for people with muscular dystrophy?,<noinput>,"Yes, there are national charities and support groups that can provide advice, emotional support, and resources for individuals and caregivers affected by muscular dystrophy, such as the Muscle Help Foundation, Muscular Dystrophy UK, Action Duchenne, and the Myotonic Dystrophy Support Group."
6,What is the purpose of the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service?,<noinput>,The National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) collects information about individuals with muscular dystrophy to help scientists find better prevention and treatment methods. It's possible to opt out of the register if desired.
0,What causes muscular dystrophy?,<noinput>,Muscular Dystrophy (MD) is caused by mutations in the genes responsible for the structure and functioning of the muscles.

4,What treatments are available for muscular dystrophy?,<noinput>,"While there's no cure for MD, treatments can include mobility assistance, support groups, surgery, and medication. Research is ongoing for potential genetic and muscle repair therapies."
5,Are there support groups available for muscular dystrophy?,<noinput>,"Yes, there are national charities like Muscle Help Foundation and Muscular Dystrophy UK, as well as local support groups, that provide emotional support and practical advice."
6,What is the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service?,<noinput>,The National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) collects information about individuals with MD for research purposes.
7,How many boys are born with Duchenne MD each year in the UK?,<noinput>,"In the UK, about 100 boys are born with Duchenne MD each year."
8,What is the life expectancy for people with myotonic dystrophy?,<noinput>,"Life expectancy for people with myotonic dystrophy can vary, but those with severe forms may have shortened lives."
9,What are some organizations that support specific types of MD?,<noinput>,"There are organizations like Action Duchenne, Duchenne UK, and the Myotonic Dystrophy Support Group that provide support for specific types of MD."
