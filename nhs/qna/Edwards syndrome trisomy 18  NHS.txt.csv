0,What is Edwards' syndrome?,<noinput>,"Edwards' syndrome, also known as trisomy 18, is a rare but serious condition where a baby has 3 copies of chromosome number 18 instead of 2, affecting their growth and development. Most babies with Edwards' syndrome will die before or shortly after being born."
1,How does Edwards' syndrome affect a baby's survival?,<noinput>,"Sadly, most babies with Edwards' syndrome will die before or shortly after being born. Only a small number, about 13 in 100, babies born alive with Edwards' syndrome will live past their 1st birthday."
2,What are the different types of Edwards' syndrome?,<noinput>,"There are three types of Edwards' syndrome: full Edwards' syndrome, mosaic Edwards' syndrome, and partial Edwards' syndrome. The severity and effects of the syndrome vary depending on the type."
3,What is the cause of Edwards' syndrome?,<noinput>,Edwards' syndrome is caused by a baby having 3 copies of chromosome number 18 instead of 2. This usually happens by chance due to a change in the sperm or egg. The chance of having a baby with Edwards' syndrome increases as the mother gets older.
4,What support is available for new parents of a baby with Edwards' syndrome?,<noinput>,"There is support available for new parents of a baby with Edwards' syndrome. Despite the complex needs of children with the syndrome, they can slowly start to do more things and have their own personalities. It is important to enjoy time with your baby and seek support where needed."
5,How is Edwards' syndrome diagnosed during pregnancy?,<noinput>,"Edwards' syndrome can be screened for between 10 and 14 weeks of pregnancy using the combined test, which includes a blood test and an ultrasound scan. If the combined test shows a higher chance of Edwards' syndrome, a diagnostic test such as chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis can be done."
6,Is there a cure for Edwards' syndrome?,<noinput>,"There is no cure for Edwards' syndrome. Treatment focuses on managing the symptoms of the condition, such as heart conditions, breathing difficulties, and infections. Supportive treatments like physiotherapy and occupational therapy may also be beneficial."
7,What advice is there for carers of someone with Edwards' syndrome?,<noinput>,"Supporting someone with Edwards' syndrome can be both rewarding and challenging. It is important for carers to take time for themselves, seek legal support and advocacy, and take care of their own wellbeing. Connecting with other parents and families in support groups or online forums can also be helpful."
8,What happens if a baby is diagnosed with Edwards' syndrome after birth?,<noinput>,"If doctors suspect a baby has Edwards' syndrome after birth, a blood sample will be taken to check for extra copies of chromosome 18. A diagnosis can be confirmed this way."
9,How is information about a baby with Edwards' syndrome shared?,<noinput>,"If a baby is diagnosed with Edwards' syndrome, their clinical team will share information about them with the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service. This helps researchers and scientists find better ways to treat the symptoms of the condition."

2,What are the types of Edwards' syndrome?,<noinput>,"There are three types of Edwards' syndrome: full Edwards' syndrome, where the extra chromosome 18 is present in all cells; mosaic Edwards' syndrome, where the extra chromosome 18 is present in some cells; and partial Edwards' syndrome, where there is only a section of the extra chromosome 18 in the cells."
3,What are the symptoms of Edwards' syndrome?,<noinput>,"The symptoms of Edwards' syndrome can vary depending on the type and severity of the condition. Common symptoms include learning disabilities, low birth weight, and a wide range of physical abnormalities.

If the screening test shows a higher chance, a diagnostic test such as chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis may be offered."
5,Is there a cure for Edwards' syndrome?,<noinput>,"There is currently no cure for Edwards' syndrome. Treatment focuses on managing the symptoms and providing supportive care.

7,What is the screening process for Edwards' syndrome during pregnancy?,<noinput>,"Screening for Edwards' syndrome is usually offered between 10 and 14 weeks of pregnancy. The combined test, which includes a blood test and an ultrasound scan, assesses the chance of the baby having Edwards' syndrome. If the fluid at the back of the baby's neck cannot be measured or the pregnancy is beyond 14 weeks, screening may be offered during the 20-week scan."
8,What happens if a baby is diagnosed with Edwards' syndrome after birth?,<noinput>,"If doctors suspect that a baby has Edwards' syndrome after birth, a blood sample will be taken to check for extra copies of chromosome 18. This helps in confirming the diagnosis of Edwards' syndrome."
9,How can carers support someone with Edwards' syndrome?,<noinput>,"Supporting someone with Edwards' syndrome can be both rewarding and challenging.
