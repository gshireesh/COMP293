0,What are the symptoms of ADPKD?,<noinput>,"Some common symptoms of ADPKD include tummy (abdominal) pain, high blood pressure, blood in the urine, upper urinary tract infections (UTIs), and kidney stones. In severe cases, kidney function may deteriorate leading to kidney failure."
1,How is ADPKD caused?,<noinput>,ADPKD is caused by genetic faults in the PKD1 or PKD2 genes. These faults disrupt the normal development of kidney cells and lead to cyst growth.
2,Can ADPKD be inherited?,<noinput>,"Yes, ADPKD can be inherited if a person has the faulty PKD1 or PKD2 gene. A child has a 50% chance of developing ADPKD if one of their parents carries the faulty gene."
3,What is the prevalence of ADPKD in the UK?,<noinput>,"It's estimated that 1 in every 1000 to 2500 people in the UK has ADPKD. This means there could be between 30,000 and 70,000 people with the condition."
4,How is ADPKD treated?,<noinput>,"While there is no cure for ADPKD, a healthy lifestyle can help protect kidney function. Various treatments are available to manage problems caused by the condition, including medication and surgical procedures."
5,What are the treatment options for kidney failure caused by ADPKD?,<noinput>,"For kidney failure caused by ADPKD, the main treatment options are dialysis, where a machine replicates kidney functions, or a kidney transplant, where a healthy kidney is implanted."
6,How does tolvaptan help treat ADPKD?,<noinput>,Tolvaptan is a medication that can be used to slow down cyst formation and protect kidney function in ADPKD.
7,What is the outlook for ADPKD?,<noinput>,"The outlook for ADPKD can vary. Some people may experience kidney failure soon after diagnosis, while others may live with relatively well-functioning kidneys. About half of people with ADPKD require treatment for kidney failure by age 60."
8,What are some potential complications of ADPKD?,<noinput>,"ADPKD can lead to complications such as high blood pressure-related heart attacks and strokes, as well as bleeding on the brain caused by a brain aneurysm."
9,How do the kidneys contribute to maintaining overall health?,<noinput>,"The kidneys play a vital role in filtering waste products from the blood, maintaining blood pressure, balancing salt and water levels, and producing hormones necessary for blood and bone health."
0,What are the symptoms of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)?,<noinput>,"The symptoms of ADPKD include tummy (abdominal) pain, high blood pressure, blood in the urine, urinary tract infections, kidney stones, and eventual kidney failure."
1,What causes autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)?,<noinput>,"ADPKD is caused by genetic faults in the genes PKD1 or PKD2, which disrupt the normal development of kidney cells and cause cysts to grow."
2,Can autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) be inherited?,<noinput>,"Yes, ADPKD can be inherited if one of the parents carries the faulty PKD1 or PKD2 gene. There is a 50% chance of a child developing ADPKD if one parent has the faulty gene."
3,What is the estimated prevalence of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) in the UK?,<noinput>,"It is estimated that 1 in every 1000 to 2500 people in the UK has ADPKD, which means there could be between 30,000 and 70,000 people with the condition in the country."
4,How is autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) treated?,<noinput>,"There is currently no cure for ADPKD, but a healthy lifestyle and medications can help manage the symptoms. In some cases, dialysis or kidney transplant may be necessary."
5,What is the outlook for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)?,<noinput>,"The outlook for ADPKD varies, with some people experiencing kidney failure soon after diagnosis, while others may live with relatively well-functioning kidneys. About half of people with ADPKD require treatment for kidney failure by the age of 60."
6,What are the potential complications of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)?,<noinput>,"ADPKD can lead to complications such as heart attacks and strokes due to high blood pressure, as well as bleeding on the brain caused by a brain aneurysm."
7,What is the role of the kidneys in the body?,<noinput>,"The kidneys filter waste products from the blood, maintain blood pressure, balance salt and water, and produce hormones necessary for blood and bone production."
8,Can autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) be prevented?,<noinput>,"Currently, there is no known way to prevent the development of ADPKD."
9,What information is shared with the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS) if someone has ADPKD?,<noinput>,Clinical information about individuals with ADPKD is shared with NCARDRS to facilitate research and improve prevention and treatment methods. Individuals can choose to opt out of the register.
