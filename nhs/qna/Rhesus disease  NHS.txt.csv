0,What is rhesus disease?,<noinput>,"Rhesus disease is a condition where antibodies in a pregnant woman's blood destroy her baby's blood cells, causing the baby to become anaemic and develop newborn jaundice."
1,What causes rhesus disease?,<noinput>,"Rhesus disease only occurs when the mother has RhD negative blood and the baby has RhD positive blood, and the mother has been previously sensitized to RhD positive blood."
2,How can rhesus disease be prevented?,<noinput>,Rhesus disease can usually be prevented through injections of a medication called anti-D immunoglobulin. This medication helps remove the baby's red blood cells from the mother's bloodstream before sensitization occurs.
3,What are the treatments for rhesus disease?,<noinput>,"Treatment for rhesus disease may include blood transfusion to the unborn baby, phototherapy, blood transfusions, and intravenous immunoglobulin injections. Without treatment, rhesus disease can lead to severe complications such as stillbirth and brain damage."
4,What are the potential complications of rhesus disease?,<noinput>,"Complications of rhesus disease may include stillbirth, brain damage, learning difficulties, hearing loss, and vision loss. However, with proper treatment, these problems are uncommon."
5,What happens if a pregnant woman with RhD negative blood is exposed to RhD positive blood?,<noinput>,"In this case, the woman's body produces antibodies that can cross the placenta and attack the baby's red blood cells, leading to rhesus disease in the unborn baby."
6,Who is at risk of developing rhesus disease?,<noinput>,Pregnant women with RhD negative blood are at risk of developing rhesus disease if the baby in her womb has RhD positive blood and she has been previously sensitized to RhD positive blood.
7,What is the role of anti-D immunoglobulin in preventing rhesus disease?,<noinput>,"Anti-D immunoglobulin is a medication that is given to RhD negative pregnant women to help remove the baby's red blood cells from the mother's bloodstream before sensitization occurs, thus preventing rhesus disease."
8,Can rhesus disease lead to stillbirth?,<noinput>,"Yes, severe cases of untreated rhesus disease can lead to stillbirth. Therefore, it is important to diagnose and treat the condition appropriately."
9,What treatments are given to the baby after delivery if they have rhesus disease?,<noinput>,"After delivery, the baby may receive treatments such as phototherapy, blood transfusions, and intravenous immunoglobulin injections to prevent the destruction of red blood cells."
0,What causes rhesus disease?,<noinput>,"Rhesus disease occurs when a mother with RhD negative blood is sensitized to RhD positive blood, usually during a previous pregnancy. Her body produces antibodies that can cross the placenta and attack the baby's red blood cells, causing rhesus disease."
1,How is rhesus disease prevented?,<noinput>,Rhesus disease can be prevented by administering injections of a medication called anti-D immunoglobulin to RhD negative mothers at certain points in their pregnancy.
2,What is the treatment for rhesus disease?,<noinput>,"The treatment for rhesus disease varies depending on its severity. In more severe cases, a blood transfusion may be needed for the unborn baby. After delivery, the child may receive phototherapy, blood transfusions, and intravenous immunoglobulin injections to prevent further damage."
3,What are the potential complications of untreated rhesus disease?,<noinput>,"If left untreated, severe cases of rhesus disease can lead to stillbirth. In other cases, it could cause brain damage, learning difficulties, hearing loss, and vision loss. However, with timely treatment, these complications are uncommon."
4,What are the symptoms of rhesus disease in a baby?,<noinput>,"The symptoms of rhesus disease in a baby include anemia and newborn jaundice. However, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis."
0,What is rhesus disease?,<noinput>,"Rhesus disease, also known as haemolytic disease of the foetus and newborn (HDFN), is a condition where antibodies in a pregnant woman's blood destroy her baby's blood cells, causing anaemia and newborn jaundice in the baby."
1,What causes rhesus disease?,<noinput>,"Rhesus disease occurs when the mother has rhesus negative blood (RhD negative) and the baby in her womb has rhesus positive blood (RhD positive). Sensitisation to RhD positive blood happens when a woman with RhD negative blood is exposed to RhD positive blood, usually during a previous pregnancy with an RhD positive baby."
2,How is rhesus disease prevented?,<noinput>,Rhesus disease can usually be prevented using injections of a medication called anti-D immunoglobulin. All RhD negative pregnant women are offered these injections at certain points in their pregnancy when they may be exposed to the baby's red blood cells.
3,What are the symptoms of rhesus disease in a baby?,<noinput>,"The symptoms of rhesus disease in a baby include anaemia and newborn jaundice. In severe cases, it can lead to stillbirth or complications such as brain damage, learning difficulties, hearing loss, and vision loss."
4,How is rhesus disease treated?,<noinput>,"The treatment for rhesus disease depends on the severity. It may involve blood transfusion to the unborn baby, phototherapy, blood transfusions, and intravenous immunoglobulin injections after delivery. Prompt treatment is important to prevent complications."
5,What are the potential complications of rhesus disease?,<noinput>,"If left untreated, severe cases of rhesus disease can lead to stillbirth. Other potential complications include brain damage, learning difficulties, hearing loss, and vision loss. However, with proper treatment, these problems are uncommon."
6,What is the role of anti-D immunoglobulin in preventing rhesus disease?,<noinput>,Anti-D immunoglobulin injections are given to RhD negative pregnant women to remove any RhD foetal blood cells before they can cause sensitisation. This helps prevent the development of antibodies that can harm the baby's blood cells.
7,What is sensitisation in the context of rhesus disease?,<noinput>,Sensitisation in the context of rhesus disease refers to the process where a woman with RhD negative blood becomes exposed to RhD positive blood and develops antibodies against it. This usually happens during a previous pregnancy with an RhD positive baby.
8,How is rhesus disease diagnosed?,<noinput>,Rhesus disease can be diagnosed through blood tests performed during pregnancy to determine the mother's blood type and the presence of RhD antibodies. The pregnancy may be monitored more closely if the woman has already developed anti-D antibodies in a previous pregnancy.
9,What is the neonatal unit and why is a baby with rhesus disease admitted to it?,<noinput>,A neonatal unit is a hospital unit that specializes in caring for newborn babies. Babies with rhesus disease may be admitted to the neonatal unit for specialized treatment and monitoring to manage their condition and prevent complications.
