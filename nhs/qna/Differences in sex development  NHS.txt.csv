0,What are some examples of types of DSDs?,<noinput>,"Some examples of types of DSDs are 46,XX DSD, 46,XY DSD, sex chromosome DSD, Rokitansky syndrome, and 46,XX ovotesticular DSD."
1,How is congenital adrenal hyperplasia related to DSD?,<noinput>,"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a common cause of 46,XX DSD. It occurs when a person lacks an enzyme needed to produce cortisol and aldosterone, resulting in increased androgen levels and the development of different-looking genitals."
2,"What is the typical chromosome pattern for individuals with 46,XY DSD?",<noinput>,"Individuals with 46,XY DSD have male XY chromosomes but may develop external genitals that are similar to girls. They may also have internal male structures such as testicles and a womb."
3,"What are some causes of 46,XY DSD?",<noinput>,"One possible cause of 46,XY DSD is androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), where the body does not respond fully or partially to androgens. Other causes of 46,XY DSD include genetic variations and differences in sex hormone production."
4,What is Rokitansky syndrome?,<noinput>,"Rokitansky syndrome, also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome (MRKH), is a condition where females are born with an underdeveloped or absent womb, cervix, and upper vagina. Their external genitalia appear normal, but they may have difficulty having sex and cannot become pregnant naturally."
5,What is the recommended course of action if a baby is suspected to have DSD?,<noinput>,"If a baby is suspected to have DSD, doctors will conduct further physical examinations, ultrasound scans, and blood tests to determine a clear diagnosis. The baby's care team will communicate the results and provide guidance on understanding and addressing the baby's development."
6,What should parents do if their older child does not go through puberty properly?,<noinput>,"If an older child does not go through puberty properly, parents should speak to a GP, who can refer the child to a specialist such as a consultant paediatric endocrinologist or an adolescent gynaecologist. A team of healthcare professionals will work with the child and their parents to understand the condition and provide support and advice."
7,Is hormone therapy an option for individuals with DSD?,<noinput>,"Hormone therapy may be an option for some individuals with DSD, along with psychological support. Depending on their circumstances and personal preferences, some individuals with DSD may consider altering the appearance of their genitals through surgery or other techniques."
8,What should someone do if they think they have a DSD?,<noinput>,"If someone thinks they have a DSD, they should speak to a GP, who can refer them to a team of specialist healthcare professionals. These professionals can provide information, answer questions, ensure their overall health, and connect them with others who have similar experiences."
9,Where can individuals with DSD or their parents find support?,<noinput>,"National DSD support groups such as the Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Support Group and DSD Families can provide valuable information, advice, and connections to others who have had similar experiences."
0,What is the cause of DSD?,<noinput>,"DSD can occur due to differences in genes, hormones, or response to sex hormones in the body. It can be inherited, but the exact cause is often unknown."
1,What are some examples of DSDs?,<noinput>,"Some examples of DSDs include 46,XX DSD (usual female pattern genes with different-looking genitals), 46,XY DSD (genes usually seen in males with genitals that look like girls'), sex chromosome DSD (e.g., Klinefelter syndrome, Turner syndrome), and 46,XX ovotesticular DSD (having both ovarian and testicular tissue)."
2,How is congenital adrenal hyperplasia related to DSD?,"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a condition where the body lacks an enzyme needed for hormone production, leading to higher androgen levels in females. It can cause differences in genital appearance, such as a larger clitoris and a vagina that is not open in the usual place.","Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a common cause of 46,XX DSD. It results in higher androgen levels in females, which can cause differences in genital appearance."
3,What is androgen insensitivity syndrome?,<noinput>,"Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is a condition where a person's body does not respond, or only partly responds, to androgens (male sex hormones). Complete insensitivity to androgens may result in a person with XY chromosomes having female characteristics, while partial insensitivity can lead to varying degrees of male or female development."
4,What is Rokitansky syndrome?,<noinput>,"Rokitansky syndrome, also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, is a condition where females are born with an underdeveloped or absent womb, cervix, and upper vagina. Their external genitalia appear normal, but they may experience difficulties with menstruation and sexual intercourse."
5,What tests are done to diagnose DSD in babies?,"Doctors may perform a physical examination, ultrasound scan, and blood tests to check genes and hormone levels.","To diagnose DSD in babies, doctors may perform a physical examination, ultrasound scan, and blood tests to check genes and hormone levels."
6,Are all forms of DSD in babies treatable with medical care?,<noinput>,"Many forms of DSD in babies do not require medical care beyond understanding their development and providing support. However, each case is unique, and it is important to consult with a specialist to determine the best course of action."
7,What should parents do if their child does not go through puberty properly?,<noinput>,"If a child does not go through puberty properly, parents should speak to a GP and seek a referral to a specialist, such as a consultant paediatric endocrinologist or an adolescent gynaecologist, who can provide appropriate support and guidance."
8,What options are available for individuals with DSD who want to explore parenthood?,<noinput>,"Individuals with DSD who want to explore parenthood can discuss their options with their specialist care team, who can provide information and guidance tailored to their specific situation."
9,Where can individuals with DSD or parents of children with DSD find support?,<noinput>,"National DSD support groups, such as the Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Support Group and DSD Families, can provide information, support, and connect individuals with others who have similar experiences."
