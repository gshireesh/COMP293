0,What are the symptoms of a cavernoma?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of a cavernoma can include bleeding, seizures, headaches, neurological problems, weakness, numbness, tiredness, memory problems, and difficulty concentrating. In some cases, it can lead to a haemorrhagic stroke."
1,What causes a cavernoma?,<noinput>,"The cause of cavernomas is often unknown, but they can sometimes run in families. In some cases, they can be linked to radiation exposure, such as previous radiotherapy to the brain."
2,Who is affected by cavernoma?,<noinput>,About 1 in every 600 people in the UK have a cavernoma that does not cause symptoms. Symptoms usually develop between the ages of 20 and 40.
3,How is cavernoma diagnosed?,<noinput>,"MRI scans are mainly used to diagnose cavernomas. CT scans or angiography can also be used, but they are not as reliable as an MRI scan."
4,How should I monitor my cavernoma symptoms?,<noinput>,It's important to closely monitor your symptoms and seek medical advice if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Your doctor may recommend further brain scans to detect bleeding or changes in the cavernoma.
5,What are the chances of a cavernoma bleeding?,<noinput>,"The risk of a haemorrhage varies from person to person. If you have not experienced any bleeding before, the chance is less than 1% each year. If you have had a previous bleed, the risk is between 4% and 25% each year."
6,How is cavernoma treated?,<noinput>,"The treatment for cavernoma depends on factors like size, location, and number of cavernomas. Medication can help control symptoms, but more invasive treatments like surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery may be offered to reduce the risk of future bleeding."
7,What are the types of treatment options for cavernoma?,<noinput>,"In the UK, neurosurgery and stereotactic radiosurgery are the main treatment options. Neurosurgery involves removing the cavernoma, while stereotactic radiosurgery aims radiation directly at the cavernoma to thicken and scar it."
8,How does having a cavernoma affect driving?,<noinput>,"If you have a cavernoma causing symptoms, it may affect your ability to drive. It is important to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) about your condition and follow their advice regarding driving."
0,What is a cavernoma?,<noinput>,"A cavernoma is a cluster of abnormal blood vessels found in the brain and spinal cord, also known as cavernous angiomas or cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM)."
1,What are the symptoms of a cavernoma?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of a cavernoma can include bleeding, seizures, headaches, neurological problems, weakness, numbness, tiredness, memory problems, and difficulty concentrating."
2,What causes a cavernoma?,<noinput>,"The exact cause of a cavernoma is often unknown, but it can sometimes run in families. Radiation exposure, such as previous radiotherapy to the brain, can also be a factor."
3,Who is affected by cavernomas?,<noinput>,It is estimated that about 1 in every 600 people in the UK have a cavernoma without symptoms. Those who experience symptoms are usually between the ages of 20 and 40.
4,How are cavernomas diagnosed?,<noinput>,"MRI scans are commonly used to diagnose cavernomas. CT scans and angiography can also be used, but they are not as reliable as MRI scans."
5,What are the chances of a cavernoma bleeding?,<noinput>,"The risk of a haemorrhage varies depending on whether there has been previous bleeding. If there has been no previous bleeding, the risk is estimated to be less than 1% per year."
6,How are cavernomas treated?,<noinput>,"The recommended treatment for cavernomas depends on factors like size, location, and the individual's circumstances. Medication can help control symptoms, but in some cases, neurosurgery or stereotactic radiosurgery may be offered to reduce the risk of future haemorrhages."
7,Can a cavernoma affect driving?,<noinput>,"If a cavernoma is causing symptoms, it may affect driving ability. It is important to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) if diagnosed with a cavernoma. Advice on how to inform the DVLA about a medical condition can be found on the GOV.UK website."
8,What are the risks of invasive treatment for cavernomas?,<noinput>,"The risks of invasive treatment such as neurosurgery or stereotactic radiosurgery depend on the location of the cavernoma. Risks can include stroke and death, but these should be discussed with a doctor before making a decision."
9,How should I monitor my cavernoma symptoms?,<noinput>,"It's important to closely monitor symptoms as a cavernoma can bleed and reabsorb blood. Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a doctor, who may recommend further brain scans."
0,What are the symptoms of cavernoma?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of cavernoma can include bleeding, seizures, headaches, neurological problems, weakness, numbness, memory problems, and difficulty concentrating."
1,What causes a cavernoma?,<noinput>,"In most cases, the cause of cavernoma is unknown. However, it can sometimes run in families or be linked to radiation exposure."
2,How common is cavernoma?,<noinput>,"It is estimated that about 1 in every 600 people in the UK has a cavernoma without symptoms. About 1 in every 400,000 people is diagnosed with symptomatic cavernoma each year."
3,How is cavernoma diagnosed?,<noinput>,"Cavernoma is typically diagnosed using MRI scans. CT scans and angiography can also be used, but MRI scans are more reliable."
4,What should I do if I experience new symptoms related to my cavernoma?,<noinput>,It is important to closely monitor your symptoms and seek medical advice if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Your doctor may recommend further brain scans.
5,What are the chances of a cavernoma bleeding?,<noinput>,"The risk of bleeding varies from person to person. If you have not experienced any bleeding before, the risk is less than 1% per year. If you have had previous bleeding, the risk is higher but decreases over time."
6,What are the treatment options for cavernoma?,<noinput>,"Treatment options for cavernoma depend on factors like size, location, and symptoms. Medication can help control symptoms, while neurosurgery or stereotactic radiosurgery may be considered to reduce the risk of future bleeding."
7,What are the risks of invasive treatment for cavernoma?,<noinput>,"Invasive treatments like neurosurgery carry risks such as stroke and death, although the exact risks depend on the location of the cavernoma. It is important to discuss the risks with your doctor."
8,How does cavernoma affect driving?,<noinput>,"If cavernoma causes symptoms, it may affect your ability to drive. It is important to inform the DVLA and follow their advice regarding driving restrictions."
9,What treatments are offered in the UK to reduce the risk of haemorrhages from cavernoma?,<noinput>,"In the UK, neurosurgery and stereotactic radiosurgery are offered to reduce the risk of haemorrhages from cavernoma. Neurosurgery is usually preferred, while radiosurgery is considered when neurosurgery is not feasible."
