0,What are the symptoms of nasopharyngeal cancer?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of nasopharyngeal cancer can include a lump in the neck that doesn’t go away after 3 weeks, hearing loss (usually only in 1 ear), tinnitus, a blocked or stuffy nose, nosebleeds, headaches, double vision, numbness in the bottom part of your face, swallowing problems, a hoarse voice, and unintentional weight loss. It's best to see a GP if you have any of these symptoms."
1,What are the causes of nasopharyngeal cancer?,<noinput>,"The exact cause of nasopharyngeal cancer is unknown, but factors that can increase the risk include being of south Chinese or north African descent, having a diet high in salt-cured meats and fish, coming into contact with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), having a job with exposure to hardwood dust or formaldehyde, and having a first-degree relative who's had the condition. The human papilloma virus (HPV) is also considered a risk factor."
2,How is nasopharyngeal cancer diagnosed?,<noinput>,"If you have symptoms of nasopharyngeal cancer, a GP may ask about your symptoms and perform examinations. You may undergo tests such as a nasendoscopy, imaging scans (MRI, CT, or PET-CT), a panendoscopy, and a biopsy. These tests can help confirm the presence of nasopharyngeal cancer and determine its stage."
3,What are the treatment options for nasopharyngeal cancer?,<noinput>,The main treatments for nasopharyngeal cancer are radiotherapy and chemotherapy. They are often used in combination. Surgery is not commonly used for nasopharyngeal cancer. Smoking cessation is important as it can increase the risk of cancer returning and worsen side effects from treatment.
4,How is radiotherapy used to treat nasopharyngeal cancer?,<noinput>,Radiotherapy is the most commonly used treatment for nasopharyngeal cancer. It can be used alone for early-stage cancers or in combination with chemotherapy for more advanced cases. Advanced techniques like intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) are used to minimize damage to surrounding tissues. Stereotactic radiotherapy may be used to target specific areas.
5,What are the side effects of radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal cancer?,<noinput>,"Radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal cancer can cause side effects such as red and sore skin in the treatment area, nausea, changes in taste, dry mouth, and hair loss. These side effects are usually temporary, but some may be permanent. It's important to inform your care team about any problems, as treatment options are available to help manage them."
6,How is chemotherapy used to treat nasopharyngeal cancer?,<noinput>,"Chemotherapy may be used alongside radiotherapy or before it for more advanced nasopharyngeal cancers. It is typically given intravenously every 3 to 4 weeks for several months. Chemotherapy can have significant side effects such as nausea, diarrhea, mouth sores, and fatigue. Discuss potential side effects with your care team before starting treatment."
7,What happens during follow-up after treatment for nasopharyngeal cancer?,<noinput>,"After completing treatment, regular follow-up appointments and scans are needed to monitor recovery and check for any signs of cancer recurrence. Initially, these appointments may be frequent but will become less frequent over time."
8,What is the outlook for nasopharyngeal cancer?,<noinput>,"The outlook for nasopharyngeal cancer depends on factors such as age, general health, and the stage of the cancer at diagnosis. Early-stage cancer can often be cured with radiotherapy. More advanced cancers can be curable if the cancer has not spread beyond the head and neck region. Survival statistics for nasopharyngeal cancer vary but in England, around 50 out of 100 people diagnosed will live for 5 years or more."
