1,How do you get amyloidosis?,<noinput>,"There are several types of amyloidosis with different causes. The main types include AL amyloidosis caused by a problem with the bone marrow, AA amyloidosis caused by long-term inflammatory conditions or infectious diseases, hereditary ATTR amyloidosis caused by an inherited genetic condition, wild-type ATTR amyloidosis which develops with age, and Beta-2 microglobulin amyloidosis which is caused by long-term dialysis."
2,What tests are done for amyloidosis?,<noinput>,"If a GP suspects amyloidosis, they will likely refer you to a specialist for tests. These may include blood tests, urine tests, electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, MRI scan, biopsy, SAP scan, and genetic testing."
3,What are the treatments for amyloidosis?,<noinput>,"While there is no cure for amyloidosis, some types can be managed through treatment to improve symptoms. Treatment options may include medications for symptom relief, reducing amyloid production, kidney dialysis, kidney or liver transplant, chemotherapy, stem cell or bone marrow transplant."
4,How is AL amyloidosis treated?,<noinput>,"For AL amyloidosis caused by a problem with the bone marrow, treatment options may include chemotherapy to destroy the blood cells causing the condition, and stem cell or bone marrow transplant."
5,What happens if you have amyloidosis?,<noinput>,"Depending on the type and progression of amyloidosis, it can eventually lead to organs such as the heart or kidneys no longer functioning properly."
6,How is amyloidosis diagnosed?,<noinput>,"Amyloidosis can be challenging to diagnose due to varying symptoms and similarities to other conditions. Diagnosis usually involves tests such as blood tests, urine tests, imaging scans, biopsy, and genetic testing."
7,What should I do if I have symptoms of amyloidosis?,<noinput>,"If you have symptoms of amyloidosis, it's important to see a GP for evaluation and further medical advice."
8,Is amyloidosis curable?,<noinput>,"Amyloidosis does not have a cure, but certain types can be managed through treatment to improve symptoms."
9,What happens if I have amyloidosis?,<noinput>,"If you are diagnosed with amyloidosis, your care team may share information about you and your condition with the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) to contribute to research and treatment advancements."

3,Are there any treatments available for amyloidosis?,<noinput>,"Although there is no cure for amyloidosis, treatments for managing symptoms include painkillers, anti-sickness medicines, diuretics, medications to reduce amyloid production, kidney dialysis, kidney or liver transplant. AL amyloidosis may be treated with chemotherapy or stem cell/bone marrow transplant."
4,How does the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) help people with amyloidosis?,<noinput>,The NCARDRS collects information about patients with amyloidosis to help scientists find better ways to prevent and treat the condition. Patients can choose to opt out of the register at any time.
5,What are the treatment options for AL amyloidosis?,<noinput>,"Treatment options for AL amyloidosis, caused by a problem with bone marrow, may include chemotherapy to destroy the blood cells in the bone marrow that cause the condition, or a stem cell or bone marrow transplant."
6,What are the symptoms of amyloidosis that require non-urgent advice?,<noinput>,"If you have symptoms of amyloidosis like feeling very tired or weak, losing weight without trying, shortness of breath, swollen feet or legs, or bruising around the eyes, it is advised to see a GP."
7,What are the symptoms of amyloidosis that can vary depending on the affected body parts?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of amyloidosis that can vary depending on the affected body parts include a fast or slow heartbeat or chest pain if the heart is affected, loss of appetite, feeling or being sick, diarrhea or constipation if the digestive system is affected, and pain, numbness, or tingling in the hands and feet if the nerves are affected."
8,What is the role of Myeloma UK in relation to AL amyloidosis?,<noinput>,Myeloma UK provides more information and support for patients with AL amyloidosis.
9,What is the role of the ATTR Amyloidosis Patients Association?,<noinput>,The ATTR Amyloidosis Patients Association provides more information and support for patients with ATTR amyloidosis.
