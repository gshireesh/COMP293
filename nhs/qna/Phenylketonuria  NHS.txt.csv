1,How is PKU diagnosed in newborns?,<noinput>,"At around 5 days old, babies are offered newborn blood spot screening to test for PKU and many other conditions."
2,What are the symptoms of untreated PKU?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of untreated PKU include behavioral difficulties, fairer skin, repeated vomiting, jerking movements, tremors, musty smell in breath, and more."
3,Are there any specific foods to avoid for PKU patients?,<noinput>,"PKU patients should avoid high protein foods like meat, fish, eggs, cheese, nuts, seeds, flour-based foods, and more."
4,Can PKU be treated with medication?,<noinput>,"Yes, there is a medicine called sapropterin that may be used with a low-protein diet to treat a milder form of PKU called hyperphenylalaninemia."
5,How is PKU inherited?,<noinput>,"PKU is inherited through autosomal recessive inheritance, meaning a baby needs to receive two copies of the mutated gene from their parents."
6,Do adults with PKU need to follow a low-protein diet?,<noinput>,"Yes, the current advice is for adults with PKU to remain on a low-protein diet for life."
7,Can PKU affect pregnancy?,<noinput>,High levels of phenylalanine in women with PKU can harm the unborn baby during pregnancy. Strict control of phenylalanine levels is necessary for a healthy pregnancy.
8,How often do children with PKU need to have blood tests?,<noinput>,"Children with PKU should have their blood tested regularly based on their age: once a week for children aged 1 year or younger, every 2 weeks for children between 1 and 12 years, and once a month for children over 12 years."
9,What happens if phenylalanine levels are not controlled during pregnancy?,<noinput>,"If phenylalanine levels are not adequately controlled during pregnancy, it can pose a risk of damage to the unborn baby. Close monitoring and proper management are crucial."
0,What is the main treatment for PKU?,<noinput>,"The main treatment for PKU is a low-protein diet and controlled intake of many other foods, such as potatoes and cereals."
1,What are the symptoms of untreated PKU?,<noinput>,"Untreated PKU can cause symptoms like behavioral difficulties, fairer skin, hair and eyes, eczema, vomiting, jerking movements, tremors, epilepsy, and a musty smell to the breath, skin, and urine."
2,How is PKU diagnosed?,<noinput>,"PKU is diagnosed through newborn blood spot screening, which involves pricking the baby's heel to test for PKU and many other conditions."
3,What is autosomal recessive inheritance?,<noinput>,"Autosomal recessive inheritance means that a baby needs to receive two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent, to develop PKU."
4,Can adults with PKU go back to a normal diet?,<noinput>,"Some adults with PKU may find it difficult to follow a low-protein diet and have returned to a normal diet. However, it is recommended for adults with PKU to remain on a low-protein diet for life for optimal functioning."
5,How often should a child with PKU have their blood tested?,<noinput>,"It is recommended that children with PKU have their blood tested once a week if they are 1 year or younger, every 2 weeks between 1 and 12 years, and once a month if they are over 12 years old."
6,Can sapropterin be used to treat PKU during pregnancy?,<noinput>,"Sapropterin may be recommended for pregnant women with hyperphenylalaninaemia, a mild form of PKU, to reduce the level of phenylalanine in the body and improve symptoms."
7,What precautions should women with PKU take during pregnancy?,<noinput>,"Women with PKU should carefully control their phenylalanine levels during pregnancy to avoid harming the unborn baby. They should follow a strict low-protein diet, monitor blood samples regularly, and may be recommended to take sapropterin."
8,How often should blood samples be provided during pregnancy for women with PKU?,<noinput>,"During pregnancy, women with PKU are asked to provide blood samples twice a week and have frequent contact with a dietitian to monitor phenylalanine levels."
9,What is the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS)?,<noinput>,The NCARDRS is a register where information about individuals with PKU and other rare conditions is collected to help researchers find better ways to prevent and treat these conditions.
