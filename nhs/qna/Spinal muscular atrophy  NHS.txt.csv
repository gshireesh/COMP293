SMA does not affect intelligence or cause learning disabilities."
1,What are the types of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)?,<noinput>,"SMA has several types: type 1, which is the most severe and develops in babies less than 6 months old, type 2, which appears in babies aged 7 to 18 months, type 3, which develops after 18 months of age, and type 4, which affects adults and usually causes mild problems."
2,Are there treatments available for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)?,<noinput>,"While there is no cure for SMA, there are treatments available to manage symptoms and improve quality of life. These may include exercises, equipment, feeding tubes, braces or surgery for spine or joint problems, and medicines targeting faulty genes."
3,What tests can be done to diagnose Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)?,<noinput>,"Genetic tests can be carried out during pregnancy or after birth to diagnose SMA. If there is a history of SMA in the family, it is advisable to speak to a doctor or genetic counselor for guidance on testing options."

There is a 25% chance for the child to have SMA, a 50% chance to be a carrier without SMA, and a 25% chance of not having SMA or being a carrier. Other types of SMA may have different inheritance patterns."
5,What is the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service?,<noinput>,The National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) is a service that collects information on individuals with spinal muscular atrophy to contribute to research for better prevention and treatment options. Participation is voluntary and individuals can choose to opt out.
6,How do I know if I should undergo genetic testing for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) during pregnancy?,<noinput>,"If you have a history of SMA in your family or are concerned about the possibility of your child having SMA, it is advisable to consult with a GP or genetic counsellor. They can provide guidance on the need for genetic testing during pregnancy."
7,What healthcare professionals may be involved in the care of individuals with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)?,<noinput>,"The care of individuals with SMA may involve various healthcare professionals, such as specialist doctors, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and speech and language therapists. They work together to provide comprehensive care and support."
8,Is there a cure for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)?,<noinput>,"Currently, there is no cure for SMA. However, ongoing research aims to find new treatments and advancements to improve the management of symptoms and overall quality of life."
9,Can Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) affect intelligence or cause learning disabilities?,<noinput>,"No, SMA does not affect intelligence or cause learning disabilities. It primarily affects muscle strength and movement, while cognitive abilities remain unaffected."
0,What are the symptoms and when do they appear in SMA?,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) causes symptoms like weak muscles, difficulty sitting up or walking, tremors, and breathing difficulties. The symptoms and their onset depend on the type of SMA.","The symptoms of SMA include weak muscles, difficulty sitting up or walking, tremors, and breathing difficulties. The onset of symptoms depends on the type of SMA."
1,How many types of SMA are there?,<noinput>,"There are four types of SMA: type 1, type 2, type 3, and type 4."
2,What is the most severe type of SMA?,<noinput>,"The most severe type of SMA is type 1, which develops in babies less than 6 months old."
3,What are the treatments available for SMA?,<noinput>,"There is currently no cure for SMA, but treatments such as exercises, equipment, feeding tubes, braces, surgery, and targeted medicines can help manage the symptoms and improve quality of life."
4,Who is involved in the care of a person with SMA?,<noinput>,"A range of healthcare professionals including specialist doctors, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and speech and language therapists may be involved in the care of a person with SMA."
5,How is SMA diagnosed?,<noinput>,SMA is diagnosed through genetic testing. Tests can be done before or after birth to check for the condition.
6,How is SMA inherited?,<noinput>,SMA is usually inherited if both parents have a faulty gene. There is a 1 in 4 chance of a child having SMA if both parents are carriers of the faulty gene.
7,What is the role of the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) in SMA?,<noinput>,The NCARDRS collects information about individuals with SMA to aid in research for better prevention and treatment. Opting out of the register is possible.
8,Can SMA be cured?,<noinput>,"There is currently no cure for SMA, but ongoing research aims to find new treatments."
9,How does SMA affect life expectancy?,<noinput>,"Life expectancy varies depending on the type of SMA. While type 1 can be severe and affect survival, other types like type 2, 3, and 4 do not usually impact life expectancy significantly."
