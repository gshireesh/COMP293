1,How are non-cancerous brain tumours graded?,<noinput>,Non-cancerous brain tumours are graded from 1 to 2 based on their growth rate and likelihood of recurrence after treatment.
2,What are the symptoms of non-cancerous brain tumours?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of non-cancerous brain tumours can include persistent headaches, seizures, nausea, drowsiness, mental or behavioral changes, weakness or paralysis, vision problems, and speech problems."
3,When should someone see a GP for a brain tumour?,<noinput>,"If someone experiences symptoms of a brain tumour, they should see a GP for assessment and further examination."
4,What are the possible causes of non-cancerous brain tumours?,<noinput>,"The exact cause of most non-cancerous brain tumours is unknown, but factors such as age, family history, genetic conditions, and previous radiotherapy can increase the risk."
5,How are non-cancerous brain tumours treated?,<noinput>,Treatment for non-cancerous brain tumours typically involves surgery to remove the tumour. Additional treatments like radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be needed for tumours that cannot be fully removed.
6,What are the potential complications after treatment for a non-cancerous brain tumour?,<noinput>,"After treatment, individuals may experience persistent problems such as seizures, difficulties with speech and walking. Supportive treatment and counseling may be beneficial for emotional aspects of the diagnosis and treatment."
7,Are non-cancerous brain tumours life-threatening?,<noinput>,"While non-cancerous brain tumours can often be successfully treated, they are still serious and can be life-threatening."
8,Where can I find support groups for non-cancerous brain tumours in the UK?,<noinput>,The Brain Tumour Charity and Brain Tumour Research have information on support groups and helplines for individuals affected by brain tumours in the UK.
9,Is radiotherapy used to treat non-cancerous brain tumours?,<noinput>,Radiotherapy may be used to treat non-cancerous brain tumours if surgery cannot remove the entire tumour or if there is a risk of recurrence.
0,What are the symptoms of a non-cancerous brain tumour?,<noinput>,"The symptoms of a non-cancerous brain tumour depend on its size and location.

2,What are the causes of non-cancerous brain tumours?,<noinput>,"The cause of most non-cancerous brain tumours is unknown. However, certain factors that may increase the risk include being over the age of 50, having a family history of brain tumours, having a genetic condition that predisposes to brain tumours, and previous radiotherapy treatment."
3,How are non-cancerous brain tumours treated?,<noinput>,"The treatment of non-cancerous brain tumours depends on the type and location of the tumour. Surgery is commonly used to remove most non-cancerous brain tumours. In cases where complete removal is not possible, other treatments like radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be used to control the growth of remaining abnormal cells."
4,What are the types and grades of non-cancerous brain tumour?,<noinput>,"There are several types of non-cancerous brain tumours, including gliomas, meningiomas, acoustic neuromas, craniopharyngiomas, haemangioblastomas, and pituitary adenomas. They are graded from 1 to 2 based on their growth rate and likelihood of recurrence."
5,How can non-cancerous brain tumours affect daily life?,<noinput>,"After treatment for a non-cancerous brain tumour, some individuals may experience persistent problems such as seizures, difficulties with speech and walking.

7,What are the grades of non-cancerous brain tumours?,<noinput>,"Non-cancerous brain tumours are typically grade 1 or 2, as they have a slower growth rate and are less likely to spread. Although they are not cancerous, they should still be taken seriously as they can be life-threatening."
8,Where can I find support groups and helplines for brain tumours in the UK?,<noinput>,The Brain Tumour Charity and Brain Tumour Research provide links to support groups and helplines for brain tumour patients in the UK. They can offer assistance and guidance during your diagnosis and treatment journey.
9,What are some different types of non-cancerous brain tumours?,<noinput>,"Non-cancerous brain tumours can include gliomas, meningiomas, acoustic neuromas, craniopharyngiomas, haemangioblastomas, and pituitary adenomas. Each type is related to the specific brain cells affected and may require tailored treatment approaches."
