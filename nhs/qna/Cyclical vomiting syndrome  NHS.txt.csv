Certain migraine prevention medications may also help."
9,What are the possible complications of CVS?,<noinput>,"Severe vomiting and retching episodes can lead to complications such as dehydration, inflammation of the food pipe (oesophagitis), tears in the lining of the food pipe (oesophagus), tooth decay, and gastroparesis (where the stomach is not able to empty itself properly)."
