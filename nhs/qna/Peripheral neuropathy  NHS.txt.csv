0,What are the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy?,<noinput>,"The main symptoms of peripheral neuropathy can include numbness and tingling in the feet or hands, burning, stabbing, or shooting pain in affected areas, loss of balance and coordination, and muscle weakness, especially in the feet."
1,When should I see a GP for peripheral neuropathy?,<noinput>,"It's important to see a GP if you experience early symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, such as pain, tingling, or loss of sensation in the feet, loss of balance or weakness, or a cut or ulcer on your foot that's not getting better."
2,What are the causes of peripheral neuropathy?,<noinput>,"In the UK, diabetes (both type 1 and type 2) is the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy. It can also be caused by physical injury to the nerves, viral infections like shingles, and side effects of certain medicines or excessive alcohol consumption."
3,How is peripheral neuropathy diagnosed?,<noinput>,"To diagnose peripheral neuropathy, a GP may ask about your symptoms and arrange tests to identify the underlying cause. You may be referred to a neurologist, a specialist in nervous system problems."
4,How is peripheral neuropathy treated?,<noinput>,"Treatment for peripheral neuropathy depends on the symptoms and underlying cause. Some causes cannot be treated directly, but better control of blood sugar levels, quitting smoking, and reducing alcohol consumption may help. Nerve pain may be treated with prescribed medicines, and other symptoms may require individual treatments such as physiotherapy or walking aids."
5,What are the complications of peripheral neuropathy?,<noinput>,"Complications of peripheral neuropathy can include foot ulcers, infections, gangrene, and in severe cases, amputation. It can also affect the nerves controlling the automatic functions of the heart and circulation system, requiring treatment to increase blood pressure or in rare cases, a pacemaker."
6,What are the different types of peripheral neuropathy?,<noinput>,"Peripheral neuropathy can affect only 1 nerve (mononeuropathy), several nerves (mononeuritis multiplex), or all the nerves in the body (polyneuropathy). Polyneuropathy is the most common type and typically starts in the feet before spreading upwards and later affecting the hands."
7,What is the peripheral nervous system?,<noinput>,"The peripheral nervous system is the network of nerves outside the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). It includes sensory nerves for transmitting sensations, motor nerves for controlling muscles, and autonomic nerves for regulating automatic body functions."
8,Who is at risk of developing peripheral neuropathy?,<noinput>,"People with diabetes are at the highest risk of developing peripheral neuropathy. Others at risk include individuals with physical injury to the nerves, viral infections, side effects of certain medicines, and excessive alcohol consumption."
9,What is the outlook for peripheral neuropathy?,<noinput>,"The outlook for peripheral neuropathy depends on the underlying cause and extent of nerve damage. Some cases may improve with treatment, while others may be permanent or worsen over time. It's important to diagnose and treat peripheral neuropathy early to prevent complications."

3,How is peripheral neuropathy diagnosed?,<noinput>,A GP will ask about your symptoms and may arrange some tests to help identify the underlying cause. You may be referred to a neurologist for further evaluation.
4,What are the treatments for peripheral neuropathy?,<noinput>,"The treatment for peripheral neuropathy depends on the symptoms and underlying cause. Sometimes, treating the underlying cause can help. Medicines called neuropathic pain agents may be prescribed for nerve pain."
5,What complications can occur from peripheral neuropathy?,<noinput>,"Complications of peripheral neuropathy can include foot ulcers that become infected, gangrene, and in severe cases, amputation. Peripheral neuropathy can also affect the nerves controlling the automatic functions of the heart and circulation system."
6,What are the different types of peripheral neuropathy?,<noinput>,"Peripheral neuropathy can affect one nerve (mononeuropathy), several nerves (mononeuritis multiplex), or all the nerves in the body (polyneuropathy). The most common type is polyneuropathy."
7,How does polyneuropathy progress?,<noinput>,"Polyneuropathy starts by affecting the longest nerves first, typically leading to symptoms in the feet. Over time, it spreads upwards, affecting shorter nerves and eventually reaching the hands."
8,What is the percentage of people over 55 affected by peripheral neuropathy in the UK?,<noinput>,It is estimated that almost 1 in 10 people aged 55 or over in the UK are affected by peripheral neuropathy.
9,How does peripheral neuropathy affect the peripheral nervous system?,<noinput>,"Peripheral neuropathy affects the peripheral nervous system, which is the network of nerves outside the central nervous system. It can impact sensory, motor, and autonomic nerves responsible for transmitting sensations, controlling muscles, and regulating automatic body functions."
