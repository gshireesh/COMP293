9,Are low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphomas treatable?,<noinput>,Low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphomas may not require immediate medical treatment but are harder to completely cure. High-grade lymphomas need prompt treatment but tend to respond better and can often be cured.
0,What is non-Hodgkin lymphoma?,<noinput>,"Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system, causing abnormal multiplication of lymphocytes and leading to the collection of these cells in certain parts of the lymphatic system. The affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making individuals more vulnerable to infections. A common symptom is painless swelling in the lymph nodes."
1,Who is affected by non-Hodgkin lymphoma?,<noinput>,"In the UK, more than 13,000 people are diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma each year. While it can occur at any age, the chances of developing the condition increase with age, with just over a third of cases diagnosed in people over 75. Slightly more men than women are affected."
2,What are the possible causes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma?,<noinput>,"The exact cause of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown. However, certain factors can increase the risk, such as having a medical condition that weakens the immune system, taking immunosuppressant medication, previous exposure to the Epstein-Barr virus, and having a close relative with the condition."
3,How is non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed?,<noinput>,"The only way to confirm a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is by conducting a biopsy, where a sample of affected lymph node tissue is removed and studied in a laboratory."
4,What are the different treatments for non-Hodgkin lymphoma?,<noinput>,"There are two broad categories of non-Hodgkin lymphoma: high-grade/aggressive and low-grade/indolent. Treatment options include chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and monoclonal antibody therapy. The specific treatment approach depends on the type, grade, extent of the lymphoma, and the patient's age."
5,Is non-Hodgkin lymphoma treatable?,<noinput>,"Most cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma are considered very treatable. The outlook and treatment may vary depending on the type, grade, and extent of the lymphoma. Low-grade tumors may not require immediate treatment, while high-grade lymphomas need prompt treatment but tend to respond well."
6,What are the potential long-term problems after non-Hodgkin lymphoma treatment?,<noinput>,"There is a risk of long-term problems after non-Hodgkin lymphoma treatment, including infertility and an increased risk of developing another type of cancer in the future."
7,What are the symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma?,<noinput>,"The most common symptom of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit, or groin. Other symptoms may include unexplained weight loss, fatigue, night sweats, and recurrent infections."
8,How does non-Hodgkin lymphoma affect the immune system?,<noinput>,Non-Hodgkin lymphoma affects the immune system by causing the affected lymphocytes to lose their infection-fighting properties. This makes individuals more vulnerable to infections.
9,Can non-Hodgkin lymphoma occur in younger individuals?,<noinput>,"Yes, non-Hodgkin lymphoma can occur at any age. While the risk increases with age, it can affect younger individuals as well."
