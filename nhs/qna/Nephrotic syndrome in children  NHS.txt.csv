1,What are the causes of nephrotic syndrome?,<noinput>,"The most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children is minimal change disease. Other possible causes include glomerulosclerosis, glomerulonephritis, infections, lupus, diabetes, sickle cell anemia, and certain types of cancer."
2,How is nephrotic syndrome diagnosed?,<noinput>,"Nephrotic syndrome is usually diagnosed by testing a urine sample for protein using a dipstick. A blood test showing low levels of albumin, a type of protein, can also confirm the diagnosis."
3,What is the main treatment for nephrotic syndrome?,<noinput>,"The main treatment for nephrotic syndrome is steroid medication, specifically prednisolone. Additional treatments may be used if side effects occur or if the condition does not respond well to steroids."

5,Are there any vaccines recommended for children with nephrotic syndrome?,<noinput>,Children with nephrotic syndrome are advised to receive the pneumococcal vaccine to reduce the risk of infections. The varicella (chickenpox) vaccine may also be recommended.
6,What other medications can be used to manage nephrotic syndrome?,<noinput>,"In addition to steroids, other medications such as levamisole, cyclophosphamide, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and rituximab may be used if the condition does not respond well to steroids or if significant side effects occur."
7,How can nephrotic syndrome be managed at home?,<noinput>,"Monitoring urine protein levels using a dipstick test, keeping a diary of results, and following the doctor's instructions for medication are important for managing nephrotic syndrome at home. Promptly contacting a doctor is necessary in case of relapses or certain symptoms."
8,How is congenital nephrotic syndrome treated?,<noinput>,"Congenital nephrotic syndrome is usually treated with frequent albumin infusions to support growth and development. In some cases, parents may be trained to administer the treatment at home. Regular clinic visits are required for monitoring."
9,What are the options for treatment if both kidneys need to be removed in congenital nephrotic syndrome?,<noinput>,"If both kidneys need to be removed, dialysis can be performed until a kidney transplant is possible. A living donor can donate a kidney, preferably a close relative."

1,What are the causes of nephrotic syndrome?,<noinput>,"The cause of most cases of nephrotic syndrome is unknown. However, it can be a result of kidney problems, glomerulosclerosis, glomerulonephritis, infections, autoimmune conditions, or certain types of cancer."
2,How is nephrotic syndrome diagnosed?,<noinput>,"Nephrotic syndrome is usually diagnosed by analyzing a urine sample for the presence of protein and conducting a blood test to measure the level of albumin protein. In some cases, a kidney biopsy may be required."
3,What are the treatment options for nephrotic syndrome?,<noinput>,"The main treatment for nephrotic syndrome is the use of steroids. Other treatment options may include diuretics, antibiotics, dietary changes, vaccinations, additional medications, and albumin infusions."
4,How can I care for my child with nephrotic syndrome at home?,<noinput>,"To care for a child with nephrotic syndrome at home, it is important to monitor their condition daily by using a dipstick to test their urine for protein. Results should be recorded in a diary along with medication dosages and any symptoms."
5,What is congenital nephrotic syndrome?,<noinput>,Congenital nephrotic syndrome is a form of the condition that is caused by an inherited faulty gene. It typically requires frequent albumin infusions to support growth and development.
6,How is congenital nephrotic syndrome treated?,<noinput>,"Treatment for congenital nephrotic syndrome often involves frequent albumin infusions, which may be administered at home or in the hospital. Dialysis or kidney transplantation may be necessary in severe cases."
7,What is the role of kidney transplants in treating nephrotic syndrome?,<noinput>,"In some cases, kidney transplants may be recommended to treat nephrotic syndrome. This involves surgically removing the affected kidneys and replacing them with a donated kidney from a living person."
8,What are the risks associated with congenital nephrotic syndrome?,<noinput>,"Congenital nephrotic syndrome can lead to serious complications such as blood clots. Regular monitoring of blood pressure, growth, kidney function, and bone health is necessary."
9,Can nephrotic syndrome be managed with medication alone?,<noinput>,"In most cases, nephrotic syndrome is managed with medication, particularly steroids. Additional medications may be used if steroids alone are not effective or if there are significant side effects."
