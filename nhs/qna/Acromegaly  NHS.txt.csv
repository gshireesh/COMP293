0,What are the early symptoms of acromegaly?,<noinput>,"Early symptoms of acromegaly include swollen hands and feet, tiredness and difficulty sleeping, changes in facial features, numbness and weakness in hands, and abnormally tall height in children."
1,What are the risks of not treating acromegaly?,<noinput>,"If acromegaly is not treated, there is a risk of developing type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, cardiomyopathy, arthritis, and bowel polyps that can potentially turn into bowel cancer."
2,What causes acromegaly?,<noinput>,"Acromegaly is caused by the overproduction of growth hormone from a non-cancerous tumor called an adenoma in the pituitary gland. Rarely, it can be caused by tumors in other parts of the body or genetic conditions."
3,How is acromegaly treated?,<noinput>,"Treatment for acromegaly depends on the symptoms. It can involve surgery to remove the pituitary tumor, medications to lower growth hormone levels, or radiotherapy. Regular follow-up appointments are necessary."
4,What are the risks of pituitary surgery for acromegaly?,<noinput>,"Pituitary surgery for acromegaly carries the risk of damaging healthy parts of the pituitary gland, leakage of brain protective fluid, and rare cases of meningitis."
5,What medications are used to treat acromegaly?,<noinput>,"Medications used to treat acromegaly include monthly injections of octreotide, lanreotide, or pasireotide to slow down growth hormone release, daily pegvisomant injections to block growth hormone effects, and bromocriptine or cabergoline tablets to stop growth hormone production in some individuals."
6,What types of radiotherapy are used for acromegaly?,<noinput>,"The two main types of radiotherapy used for acromegaly are stereotactic radiotherapy, which delivers a high-dose beam of radiation precisely to the adenoma, and conventional radiotherapy, which uses a wider beam over several weeks."
7,What are the side effects of radiotherapy for acromegaly?,<noinput>,"Radiotherapy for acromegaly can cause a drop in other hormone levels, requiring hormone replacement therapy. It can also affect fertility and have other potential side effects. Your doctor can provide more information and discuss the risks."
8,What is the process for diagnosing acromegaly?,<noinput>,"Diagnosing acromegaly involves evaluating symptoms and conducting blood tests to measure growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 levels. Brain scans, such as MRI or CT scans, may also be performed to locate and assess the pituitary adenoma."
9,What is the role of the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service in acromegaly?,<noinput>,The National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) collects information about individuals with acromegaly to support research and improve treatment options. Participation in the register is optional.
0,What are the early symptoms of acromegaly?,<noinput>,"Early symptoms of acromegaly include swollen hands and feet, tiredness, changes in facial features, numbness and weakness in hands, and abnormal height in children and teenagers."
1,What are the risks of not getting treatment for acromegaly?,<noinput>,"If left untreated, acromegaly can lead to type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, cardiomyopathy, arthritis, and bowel polyps which can potentially turn into bowel cancer."
2,What causes acromegaly?,<noinput>,Acromegaly is caused by a non-cancerous tumor in the pituitary gland called an adenoma. It can also be caused by tumors in other parts of the body or genetic conditions.
3,How can acromegaly be treated?,<noinput>,"Treatment for acromegaly depends on the symptoms and may involve surgery to remove the tumor, medication to control growth hormone levels, or radiotherapy. Regular follow-up appointments are necessary after treatment."
4,What are the side effects of surgery for acromegaly?,"Surgery for acromegaly carries the risk of damaging healthy parts of the pituitary gland, leakage of brain fluid, or rare complications like meningitis.","The risks of surgery for acromegaly include potential damage to healthy parts of the pituitary gland, leakage of brain fluid, and rare complications like meningitis."
5,What are the medications used to treat acromegaly?,<noinput>,"Medications used to treat acromegaly include octreotide, lanreotide, pasireotide (monthly injections), pegvisomant (daily injections), and bromocriptine or cabergoline tablets."
6,What is radiotherapy and when is it used for acromegaly?,<noinput>,"Radiotherapy is a treatment option for acromegaly when surgery is not possible or the tumor couldn't be completely removed. It uses radiation to reduce growth hormone levels, but it may take several years to show noticeable effects."
7,What follow-up is required after treatment for acromegaly?,<noinput>,"After treatment, regular follow-up appointments are necessary to monitor pituitary gland function, hormone replacement therapy, and to prevent the return of the condition."
8,How is acromegaly diagnosed?,<noinput>,Acromegaly is diagnosed through blood tests to measure growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 levels. Imaging scans such as MRI or CT may also be used to locate the tumor in the pituitary gland.
9,What is the role of the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service in acromegaly?,<noinput>,The National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service collects information about individuals with acromegaly to help in research for better treatments and prevention methods.
