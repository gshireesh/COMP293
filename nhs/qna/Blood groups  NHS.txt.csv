0,What are the 4 main blood groups?,<noinput>,"The 4 main blood groups are A, B, AB, and O."
1,How is blood group determined?,<noinput>,Blood group is determined by the genes inherited from parents.
2,What are antibodies and antigens in the blood?,<noinput>,Antibodies are proteins found in plasma that recognize and destroy foreign substances. Antigens are protein molecules found on the surface of red blood cells.
3,What is the ABO blood group system?,<noinput>,"The ABO system categorizes blood groups into A, B, AB, and O based on the presence or absence of A and B antigens."
4,Which blood group is the most common?,<noinput>,"Blood group O is the most common, with approximately 48% of the UK population having this blood group."
5,What happens if someone receives blood from the wrong ABO group?,<noinput>,Receiving blood from the wrong ABO group can be life-threatening as the antibodies in the recipient's plasma may attack the transfused red blood cells.
6,What is the Rh system?,<noinput>,The Rh system categorizes blood groups into RhD positive or RhD negative based on the presence or absence of the RhD antigen.
7,What is the most common blood type in the UK?,<noinput>,"The most common blood type in the UK is O RhD positive (O+), making up approximately 35% of the population."
8,How is blood group tested?,<noinput>,Blood group is tested by mixing red blood cells with different antibody solutions to observe the clumping reaction.
9,Why are pregnant women always given a blood group test?,<noinput>,"Pregnant women are given a blood group test to check for RhD negative mothers carrying RhD-positive babies, as it can lead to complications if left untreated."
0,How many main blood groups are there?,<noinput>,There are 4 main blood groups.
1,What are antibodies and antigens in the blood?,<noinput>,Antibodies are proteins that recognize foreign substances in the blood and alert the immune system. Antigens are protein molecules found on the surface of red blood cells.
2,What is the most common blood group?,<noinput>,"The most common blood group is O, which is found in almost half of the UK population."
3,Why is it important to match blood groups before a transfusion?,<noinput>,Matching blood groups before a transfusion is important to prevent life-threatening reactions between different blood types.
4,How is the RhD antigen related to blood groups?,<noinput>,The presence or absence of the RhD antigen determines whether a blood group is RhD positive or RhD negative.
5,Can O RhD negative blood be given to anyone?,<noinput>,O RhD negative blood is safe for most recipients and can be given to anyone in most cases.
6,How is blood group determined?,Blood group is determined by the genes inherited from parents.,Blood group is determined by the genes inherited from parents.
7,Why are pregnant women given a blood group test?,<noinput>,Pregnant women are given a blood group test to identify if there is a risk of complications due to RhD incompatibility.
8,Who can donate blood?,<noinput>,"Most people who are fit, healthy, and within the age range of 17 to 65 years can donate blood."
9,How can I book an appointment to donate blood?,<noinput>,You can book an appointment to donate blood online or by calling 0300 123 23 23.
