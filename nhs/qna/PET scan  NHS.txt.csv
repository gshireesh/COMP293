0,What are PET scans used for?,<noinput>,"PET scans are used to show how well certain parts of the body are functioning, to determine the spread and response to treatment of cancer, to plan operations, and to diagnose brain conditions like dementia."
1,How do PET scans work?,<noinput>,"PET scans work by detecting the radiation emitted by a radiotracer substance that is injected into the body. By analyzing the areas where the radiotracer accumulates, it's possible to assess the functioning of different body processes."
2,What preparations are needed for a PET scan?,<noinput>,"Before a PET scan, you may be instructed to fast for 6 hours and avoid strenuous exercise for 24 hours. It's recommended to wear loose, comfortable clothes and to remove any metal objects. In case of claustrophobia, you can consult with the hospital staff for possible sedative options."
3,What happens during a PET scan?,<noinput>,"During a PET scan, a radiotracer is injected into your vein. Then, you lie on a flat bed that moves into a cylindrical scanner. It's important to stay still and avoid talking during the scan, which usually takes 30 to 60 minutes. Afterward, there are usually no side effects and you can go home the same day."
4,What are the possible risks of a PET scan?,<noinput>,"The radiation exposure during a PET scan carries a very small risk of potential tissue damage and radiation-induced cancer, but the amount of radiation in a standard PET scan is safe. The radioactive substance is quickly eliminated from the body, and it's advised to avoid close contact with pregnant women, babies, and young children temporarily."
5,What are common uses of PET scans in cancer care?,<noinput>,"PET scans are particularly useful in determining the spread of cancer, evaluating the effectiveness of treatment, and planning surgical interventions like coronary artery bypass graft or brain surgery for epilepsy."
6,Which scan can provide even more detailed images when combined with a PET scan?,<noinput>,"CT scans can be combined with PET scans to produce more detailed images. This combination, known as PET-CT scan, provides a comprehensive view of the body's structure and function."
7,What are some conditions that can be diagnosed using PET scans?,<noinput>,"PET scans can aid in diagnosing conditions that affect the normal functioning of the brain, such as dementia. They can also help in identifying cancerous cells that consume glucose at a faster rate than normal cells."
8,What should be avoided before a PET scan?,<noinput>,"Before a PET scan, it is advised to avoid eating for at least 6 hours prior to the scan. Strenuous exercise should also be avoided for 24 hours. Loose, comfortable clothes are recommended to wear, while jewelry and clothing with metal parts should be removed."
9,When are PET-CT scans commonly used?,<noinput>,PET-CT scans are commonly used in cancer care to provide detailed images that help determine the spread and response to treatment of cancer. They can also be used in other conditions where a comprehensive view of structure and function is required.
0,What are the uses of PET scans?,<noinput>,"PET scans are used to determine the extent and response to treatment of cancer, plan operations, and diagnose conditions affecting brain function such as dementia."
1,How do PET scans work?,<noinput>,"PET scanners detect the radiation emitted by a radiotracer called fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) which is injected into the body. By analyzing the areas where the radiotracer accumulates, the functioning of specific body parts can be determined."
2,What preparations should be made for a PET scan?,<noinput>,"Patients should avoid eating for 6 hours before the scan, avoid strenuous exercise for 24 hours before the scan, and wear loose, comfortable clothing. They may also consider requesting a mild sedative if they are claustrophobic."
3,What happens during a PET scan?,<noinput>,"During a PET scan, a radiotracer is injected into a vein and the patient is asked to lie still while the scanner takes pictures. The scan usually takes 30 to 60 minutes and is painless."
4,What are the potential risks of a PET scan?,<noinput>,"The amount of radiation exposure in a standard PET scan is safe and the radiotracer is eliminated from the body naturally within a few hours. Some precautions, such as avoiding close contact with pregnant women and children, may be advised."
5,How are PET scans combined with other imaging techniques?,<noinput>,"PET scans can be combined with CT scans or MRI scans to produce more detailed and comprehensive images. This is known as PET-CT or PET-MRI scan, depending on the type of combination."
6,Can PET scans show abnormal areas in the body?,<noinput>,"Yes, PET scans can clearly show abnormal areas in the part of the body being investigated. They are particularly helpful in diagnosing and evaluating the spread of cancer."
7,Do PET scans cause any side effects?,<noinput>,"After a PET scan, there are usually no side effects. The results of the scan will be discussed with the patient's specialist at a later appointment."
8,Are PET scans safe during pregnancy?,<noinput>,"As a precaution, it is advised to avoid close contact with pregnant women, babies, and young children for a few hours after a PET scan, as the patient may be slightly radioactive during that time."
9,What additional radiation exposure is involved in a PET-CT scan?,<noinput>,"The CT component of a PET-CT scan exposes the patient to a small amount of additional radiation. However, the risk of this causing problems in the future is still very small."
