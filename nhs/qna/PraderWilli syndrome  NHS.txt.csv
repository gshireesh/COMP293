0,What are the typical symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome?,<noinput>,"Typical symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome include excessive appetite and overeating, restricted growth, weak muscles, learning difficulties, lack of sexual development, and behavioral challenges."
1,What causes Prader-Willi syndrome?,<noinput>,"Prader-Willi syndrome is caused by missing genetic material in specific genes on chromosome number 15, which affects the hypothalamus, the part of the brain responsible for hormones, growth, and appetite."
2,How is Prader-Willi syndrome diagnosed?,<noinput>,"Prader-Willi syndrome can usually be confirmed through genetic testing, especially if a child shows symptoms or has weak muscles at birth."
3,How is Prader-Willi syndrome managed?,<noinput>,"There is no cure for Prader-Willi syndrome, but treatment focuses on managing symptoms and difficulties, including controlling excessive appetite and behavioral challenges. Maintaining a normal weight through a healthy, balanced diet is important."
4,What long-term problems can be caused by Prader-Willi syndrome?,<noinput>,"Although Prader-Willi syndrome itself is not life-threatening, weight gain and compulsive eating can lead to serious obesity-related conditions such as type 2 diabetes, heart failure, and breathing difficulties."
5,What support is available for people affected by Prader-Willi syndrome in the UK?,<noinput>,The Prader-Willi Syndrome Association UK (PWSA UK) provides information and support. Their helpline can be reached at 01332 365676.
6,What is the role of the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service in relation to Prader-Willi syndrome?,<noinput>,"If a child has Prader-Willi syndrome, the clinical team may share information with the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) to aid research for prevention and treatment."
7,What are the risks associated with the increased appetite in Prader-Willi syndrome?,<noinput>,The increased appetite in Prader-Willi syndrome poses a higher risk of choking on food. Caregivers and carers are advised to learn what to do in case of a choking incident.
8,Can adults with Prader-Willi syndrome lead independent lives?,<noinput>,"While adults with Prader-Willi syndrome can have a good quality of life and participate in activities like voluntary or part-time work, it is unlikely that they will be able to live fully independent lives."
9,Is Prader-Willi syndrome genetic and can it be inherited?,<noinput>,"Prader-Willi syndrome is caused by missing genetic material and usually occurs spontaneously, with a very low chance of parents having more than one child with the syndrome."
0,What are the typical symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome?,<noinput>,"Typical symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome include excessive appetite and overeating, restricted growth, weak muscles, learning difficulties, lack of sexual development, and behavioral challenges."
1,How is Prader-Willi syndrome diagnosed?,<noinput>,"Prader-Willi syndrome can usually be confirmed through genetic testing, which is recommended if a child has symptoms of the syndrome or is very floppy at birth."
2,What are the causes of Prader-Willi syndrome?,<noinput>,"Prader-Willi syndrome is caused by missing genetic material in a group of genes on chromosome number 15. This leads to problems in the hypothalamus, affecting growth and appetite."
3,How is Prader-Willi syndrome managed?,<noinput>,"There is no cure for Prader-Willi syndrome, but management involves controlling excessive appetite and behavioral challenges. It's important to maintain a normal weight and have a healthy, balanced diet."
4,What are the long-term problems caused by Prader-Willi syndrome?,<noinput>,"While Prader-Willi syndrome itself is not life-threatening, compulsive eating and weight gain can lead to obesity-related conditions such as type 2 diabetes, heart failure, and breathing difficulties."
5,How can the Prader-Willi Syndrome Association UK (PWSA UK) help?,<noinput>,PWSA UK provides information and support for people affected by Prader-Willi syndrome. They can be contacted through their helpline at 01332 365676.
6,What is the role of the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) in Prader-Willi syndrome?,<noinput>,"If your child has Prader-Willi syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about them to the NCARDRS, which helps researchers find better ways to prevent and treat the syndrome."
7,Can adults with Prader-Willi syndrome live fully independent lives?,<noinput>,"It's unlikely for adults with Prader-Willi syndrome to live fully independent lives, but with a well-controlled diet, they can have a good quality of life and a normal life expectancy."
8,What are some serious obesity-related conditions that can develop in young adults with Prader-Willi syndrome?,<noinput>,"Young adults with Prader-Willi syndrome and excessive weight gain are at risk of developing serious obesity-related conditions such as type 2 diabetes, heart failure, and breathing difficulties."
9,How can carers help prevent choking on food in individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome?,<noinput>,"Carers of individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome are advised to learn what to do if someone is choking, as the increased appetite in Prader-Willi syndrome increases the risk of choking on food."
