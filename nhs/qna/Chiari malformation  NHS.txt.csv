1,How are Chiari I malformations treated?,<noinput>,"Treatment for Chiari I malformations depends on the severity of symptoms. Painkillers can help with headaches and neck pain. In severe cases, surgery called decompression surgery may be recommended."
2,What is decompression surgery for Chiari I malformation?,<noinput>,"Decompression surgery is the main treatment for Chiari I malformation. It involves removing a small piece of bone from the skull to relieve pressure on the brain, allowing normal fluid flow."
3,Are Chiari I malformations life-threatening?,<noinput>,"Chiari I malformations are generally not considered life-threatening. However, they can cause painful symptoms and there is a risk of developing syringomyelia, which can be damaging if not treated."

9,What is the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service?,<noinput>,The National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) is a register where information about people affected by Chiari malformation and other conditions is collected for research purposes. Opting out is possible.
0,What is a Chiari I malformation?,<noinput>,"A Chiari I malformation is where the lowest part of the back of the brain extends into the spinal canal, putting pressure on the brainstem and spinal cord."

4,What is decompression surgery for Chiari malformation?,<noinput>,Decompression surgery is the main operation for Chiari malformation. It involves removing a small piece of bone from the skull and sometimes from the top of the spine to alleviate pressure on the brain and restore normal fluid flow.
5,What other procedures may be necessary for Chiari I malformations?,<noinput>,"Other procedures that may be necessary include endoscopic third ventriculostomy, ventriculoperitoneal shunting, untethering, and spinal fixation, depending on the specific case."
6,What causes Chiari I malformations?,<noinput>,"The exact cause of Chiari I malformations is unknown, but it's thought to be present from birth. Some cases may be the result of the skull not being large enough for the brain, and it can also be associated with other conditions like a tethered spinal cord or brain tumour."
7,Can Chiari malformations run in families?,<noinput>,"Chiari malformations can sometimes run in families, suggesting a potential genetic component. However, the risk of passing it on to a child is very small, and even if inherited, they may not experience symptoms."
8,What information is collected by the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service?,<noinput>,"If you have a Chiari malformation, your information may be passed on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service to help with research on prevention and treatment."
9,How can I opt out of the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service?,<noinput>,"You can opt out of the register at any time. For more information, you can visit the website of the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service."
