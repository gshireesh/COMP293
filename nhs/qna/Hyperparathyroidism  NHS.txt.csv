0,What are the symptoms of hyperparathyroidism?,<noinput>,"Possible signs of hyperparathyroidism include depression, tiredness, feeling thirsty and peeing a lot, feeling sick and losing your appetite, muscle weakness, constipation, tummy pain, loss of concentration, and mild confusion."
1,What can high blood calcium levels (hypercalcaemia) cause in hyperparathyroidism?,<noinput>,"If hyperparathyroidism is not treated, it can lead to high blood calcium levels (hypercalcaemia), which may cause symptoms like vomiting, drowsiness, dehydration, confusion, muscle spasms, bone pain or tenderness, joint pain, irregular heartbeat, and high blood pressure."
2,How is hyperparathyroidism diagnosed?,<noinput>,"Hyperparathyroidism is diagnosed after a blood test shows high levels of parathyroid hormone and high levels of blood calcium, often with low levels of phosphorus. Additional tests like DEXA scan, X-rays, CT scans, or ultrasound scans may be done to detect bone loss, fractures, calcium deposits, or kidney stones."
3,What are the types of hyperparathyroidism?,<noinput>,"There are 3 types of hyperparathyroidism: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary hyperparathyroidism is caused by a problem within the parathyroid gland, secondary hyperparathyroidism is caused by another condition that lowers calcium levels, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism occurs in long-standing secondary hyperparathyroidism."
4,What causes primary hyperparathyroidism?,<noinput>,"In most cases, primary hyperparathyroidism is caused by a non-cancerous tumour called an adenoma on one of the parathyroid glands. It can also occur due to enlarged parathyroid glands (hyperplasia) or rarely, cancer of a parathyroid gland. Women and people over 60 are more likely to develop primary hyperparathyroidism."
5,How is primary hyperparathyroidism treated?,<noinput>,"Surgery to remove the parathyroid gland is usually the main treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism. In cases with very high calcium levels, hospital admission and intravenous fluids may be needed. Bisphosphonates may be given to lower calcium temporarily. For those unable to have surgery, cinacalcet may be used to control the condition."
6,What is the treatment for secondary hyperparathyroidism?,<noinput>,"Treatment for secondary hyperparathyroidism depends on the underlying cause. The most common cause is low vitamin D, which can be corrected with oral vitamin D (colecalciferol). Other causes, like kidney disease, require targeted treatment."
7,How is tertiary hyperparathyroidism treated?,<noinput>,Surgery is usually the main treatment for tertiary hyperparathyroidism that occurs in very advanced kidney failure.
8,Are there any dietary recommendations for hyperparathyroidism?,<noinput>,"While a healthy, balanced diet is important, there is no need to completely avoid calcium. Avoiding a high-calcium diet and staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water is recommended. Medications like thiazide diuretics should be avoided as they can raise calcium levels and cause dehydration."
9,What complications can hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcaemia cause?,<noinput>,"Hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcaemia can cause complications such as osteoporosis, bone fractures, kidney stones, kidney damage or failure, stomach ulcers, and pancreatitis. In rare severe cases, they can lead to rapid kidney failure, loss of consciousness, coma, or life-threatening heart rhythm abnormalities."
0,What are the symptoms of hyperparathyroidism?,<noinput>,"Possible signs of hyperparathyroidism include depression, tiredness, feeling thirsty and peeing a lot, feeling sick and losing your appetite, muscle weakness, constipation, tummy pain, loss of concentration, and mild confusion."
1,What complications can occur due to hypercalcaemia?,<noinput>,"Hypercalcaemia can cause complications such as osteoporosis and bone fractures, kidney stones and blockage, kidney damage or failure, stomach ulcers, and pancreatitis."
2,How is hyperparathyroidism diagnosed?,<noinput>,"Hyperparathyroidism is diagnosed through blood tests that show high levels of parathyroid hormone and blood calcium, often with low levels of phosphorus. Imaging tests like DEXA scan, X-rays, CT scans, or ultrasound scans may also be used."
3,What are the types of hyperparathyroidism?,<noinput>,"There are 3 types of hyperparathyroidism: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary hyperparathyroidism is caused by a problem within the parathyroid gland itself, secondary hyperparathyroidism is a reaction to another condition like kidney failure, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism occurs when secondary hyperparathyroidism starts behaving like primary hyperparathyroidism."
4,What are the causes of primary hyperparathyroidism?,<noinput>,Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually caused by a non-cancerous tumour called an adenoma on one of the parathyroid glands. It can also occur if 2 or more glands become enlarged (hyperplasia) or very rarely due to cancer of a parathyroid gland.
5,How is primary hyperparathyroidism treated?,<noinput>,"Surgery to remove the parathyroid gland is usually the main treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism. In some cases, medication or a healthy diet may be recommended as well."
6,What is the treatment for secondary hyperparathyroidism?,<noinput>,The treatment for secondary hyperparathyroidism depends on the underlying cause. It may involve correcting low vitamin D levels or addressing kidney disease.
7,How is tertiary hyperparathyroidism treated?,<noinput>,Surgery is the main treatment for tertiary hyperparathyroidism that occurs in advanced kidney failure.
8,What should be avoided in the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism?,<noinput>,"In the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism, it is important to avoid high-calcium diet and certain medications like thiazide diuretics."
9,Can a lack of dietary calcium lead to complications?,"Lack of dietary calcium is more likely to lead to a loss of calcium from the skeleton, resulting in brittle bones (osteoporosis).","Yes, a lack of dietary calcium can lead to complications such as osteoporosis."
