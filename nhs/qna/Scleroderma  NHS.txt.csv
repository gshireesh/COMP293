1,What is the difference between plaque and linear morphoea?,<noinput>,"Plaque morphoea causes discoloured oval patches on the skin, while linear morphoea causes thickened skin in lines along the arms and legs of children."
2,What are the symptoms of limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis may include thickening of the skin over the hands, feet, and face, red spots on the skin, hard lumps under the skin, heartburn, and problems swallowing (dysphagia)."
3,What are the symptoms of diffuse systemic sclerosis?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of diffuse systemic sclerosis may include weight loss, fatigue, joint pain, and stiffness."
4,What causes scleroderma?,<noinput>,"The exact cause of scleroderma is unclear, but it is thought to be related to an overactive immune system and genetic factors."
5,What are the common treatments for scleroderma?,<noinput>,"Common treatments for scleroderma include medication to improve circulation, immune system-suppressing drugs, steroids, moisturizing affected areas of the skin, and various medicines to control symptoms."
6,How can I manage living with scleroderma?,<noinput>,"Therapies and lifestyle changes that can help manage scleroderma include regular physiotherapy and stretching exercises, adapting to movement difficulties with the help of an occupational therapist, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle."
7,Is pregnancy possible for women with systemic sclerosis?,<noinput>,"Women with systemic sclerosis may find it harder to get pregnant and have a slightly higher risk of miscarriage and premature birth, but with proper planning and consultation with a doctor, successful pregnancies are possible."
0,What are the two main types of scleroderma?,<noinput>,The two main types of scleroderma are localised scleroderma (morphoea) and systemic sclerosis.
1,What are the two main types of localised scleroderma?,<noinput>,The two main types of localised scleroderma are plaque morphoea and linear morphoea.
2,What are the symptoms of limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis?,"Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis usually only affects the skin on the hands, lower arms, feet, lower legs, and face. It can have symptoms such as thickening of the skin, red spots, hard lumps, heartburn, and swallowing problems.","The symptoms of limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis include thickening of the skin, red spots, hard lumps, heartburn, and swallowing problems."
3,How is scleroderma thought to occur?,<noinput>,"Scleroderma is thought to occur because part of the immune system has become overactive and produces too much collagen, causing scarring and thickening of the tissue."
4,What are the common treatments for scleroderma?,<noinput>,"The common treatments for scleroderma include medication to improve circulation, immune system-suppressing medicines, steroids, moisturising affected skin areas, and various medicines to control symptoms."
5,What lifestyle changes can help with living with scleroderma?,<noinput>,"Lifestyle changes such as regular physiotherapy, stretching exercises, adapting to movement difficulties with the help of an occupational therapist, maintaining warmth for Raynaud's, and adopting a healthy lifestyle can help with living with scleroderma."
6,How does scleroderma affect pregnancy?,<noinput>,"Women with systemic sclerosis may find it harder to get pregnant and have a slightly higher risk of miscarriage and premature birth. However, with proper planning and consultation with a doctor, successful pregnancies can still occur."
7,What resources are available for people affected by scleroderma?,<noinput>,Scleroderma & Raynaud's UK (SRUK) provides information and support for people affected by scleroderma and Raynaud's.
8,Is there a cure for scleroderma?,<noinput>,"No, there is currently no cure for scleroderma, but symptoms can be managed with different treatments."
9,What are the types of systemic sclerosis?,<noinput>,The types of systemic sclerosis are limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis and diffuse systemic sclerosis.
0,What are the two main types of scleroderma?,<noinput>,The two main types of scleroderma are localised scleroderma (morphoea) and systemic sclerosis.
1,How does localised scleroderma (morphoea) mostly affect the skin?,<noinput>,Localised scleroderma (morphoea) mostly affects the skin by causing one or more hard patches to develop.
2,What are the two main types of localised scleroderma?,<noinput>,The two main types of localised scleroderma are plaque morphoea and linear morphoea.
3,How does plaque morphoea appear on the skin?,<noinput>,"Plaque morphoea appears as one or more discoloured oval patches on the skin, which may be hairless and shiny."
4,How does linear morphoea affect the skin in children?,<noinput>,"Linear morphoea causes thickened skin in lines, mostly along the arms and legs of children, but also on the forehead and scalp."
5,How does systemic sclerosis differ from localised scleroderma?,<noinput>,"Systemic sclerosis can affect internal organs in addition to the skin, while localised scleroderma mostly affects the skin."
6,What are the two types of systemic sclerosis?,<noinput>,The two types of systemic sclerosis are limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis and diffuse systemic sclerosis.
7,What are the characteristic symptoms of limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis?,<noinput>,"The characteristic symptoms of limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis include thickening of the skin, red spots, hard lumps, heartburn, and problems swallowing."
8,What are the characteristic symptoms of diffuse systemic sclerosis?,<noinput>,"The characteristic symptoms of diffuse systemic sclerosis include weight loss, fatigue, joint pain, and stiffness."
9,What causes scleroderma?,<noinput>,"The exact cause of scleroderma is unclear, but it is believed to involve an overactive immune system and genetic factors."
