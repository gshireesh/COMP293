2,What causes a phaeochromocytoma?,<noinput>,"While many phaeochromocytomas occur for no obvious reason, some are caused by genetic disorders like von Hippel-Lindau syndrome and neurofibromatosis type 1."
3,How is a phaeochromocytoma treated?,<noinput>,Most people with a phaeochromocytoma will need surgery to have the tumor removed. Medications like alpha blockers may be given before the operation to stabilize heart rate and blood pressure.
4,What are the possible risks of a phaeochromocytoma surgery?,<noinput>,"The risks of phaeochromocytoma surgery include bleeding, infection, damage to surrounding structures, and adverse reactions to anesthesia. Your doctor will explain the risks in detail."
5,Can a phaeochromocytoma come back after surgery?,<noinput>,"In a small number of people, the tumor may come back after surgery. Regular check-ups are important to catch any recurrence early for prompt treatment."
6,How can a phaeochromocytoma affect the adrenal glands?,<noinput>,"A phaeochromocytoma can cause the adrenal glands to produce excessive adrenaline and noradrenaline, which can lead to symptoms like heart palpitations and high blood pressure."
7,Are all phaeochromocytomas cancerous?,<noinput>,"No, most phaeochromocytomas are non-cancerous (benign), but around 1 in 10 are cancerous (malignant)."
8,What are the long-term effects of an untreated phaeochromocytoma?,<noinput>,"If left untreated, phaeochromocytomas can lead to severe problems such as irregular heartbeat, heart attacks, strokes, and organ failure."
9,What other treatments may be needed if a phaeochromocytoma is cancerous?,<noinput>,"If a phaeochromocytoma is cancerous, chemotherapy or radiotherapy may be recommended in addition to surgery."

2,What causes a phaeochromocytoma?,<noinput>,"While many phaeochromocytomas occur for no obvious reason, some are associated with inherited genetic disorders such as von Hippel-Lindau syndrome or neurofibromatosis type 1."
3,How is a phaeochromocytoma treated?,<noinput>,Most people with a phaeochromocytoma will need surgery to remove the tumour. Medications called alpha blockers and beta blockers may be given before surgery to stabilize heart rate and blood pressure.
4,What are the risks if a phaeochromocytoma is left untreated?,<noinput>,"Untreated phaeochromocytomas can lead to severe problems such as irregular heartbeat, heart attacks, strokes, and organ failure."
5,Can a phaeochromocytoma come back after surgery?,<noinput>,"In a small number of cases, a phaeochromocytoma may come back after surgery. Regular check-ups are important to detect any recurrence."
6,What hormones do adrenal glands produce?,<noinput>,"The adrenal glands produce hormones such as adrenaline and noradrenaline, which control heart rate, blood pressure, and metabolism."
7,How do phaeochromocytomas affect the adrenal glands?,<noinput>,"Phaeochromocytomas can cause the adrenal glands to produce excessive amounts of hormones, leading to symptoms like heart palpitations and high blood pressure."
8,Are all phaeochromocytomas cancerous?,<noinput>,"No, most phaeochromocytomas are non-cancerous (benign). However, a small percentage can be cancerous (malignant)."
9,What are the possible types of surgery for phaeochromocytomas?,<noinput>,Surgery for phaeochromocytomas can be either laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery with small incisions or open surgery with a larger incision. The best type of surgery depends on individual circumstances.
