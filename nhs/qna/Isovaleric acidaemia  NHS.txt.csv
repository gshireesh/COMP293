0,What causes isovaleric acidaemia (IVA)?,<noinput>,"IVA is caused by the body's inability to process the amino acid leucine, leading to a harmful build-up of isovaleric acid in the blood and urine."
1,What are the symptoms of isovaleric acidaemia (IVA)?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of IVA may include a distinctive odour of ""sweaty feet"", poor feeding, weight loss, and episodes of metabolic crisis which can result in lack of energy, vomiting, irritability, and breathing difficulties."
2,How is isovaleric acidaemia (IVA) diagnosed?,<noinput>,"IVA can be diagnosed through newborn blood spot screening, which involves collecting drops of blood from a baby's heel to test for the condition."
3,How is isovaleric acidaemia (IVA) treated?,<noinput>,"Treatment for IVA involves a low-protein diet tailored to reduce leucine intake, medication to help clear excess isovaleric acid, and emergency treatment during illness or infection."
4,How is isovaleric acidaemia (IVA) inherited?,<noinput>,"IVA is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning a baby needs to receive one affected gene from each parent to develop the condition."
5,What are the risks of untreated isovaleric acidaemia (IVA)?,<noinput>,"Untreated IVA can lead to severe and life-threatening symptoms such as seizures, coma, brain damage, and developmental delay."
6,What is the treatment approach for IVA during an infection or illness?,<noinput>,"During an infection or illness, an emergency diet with high-sugar drinks is used to replace milk and protein-containing foods. Medication should still be taken as normal."
7,Do babies with IVA need to continue treatment for life?,<noinput>,"Yes, treatment for IVA must be continued for life to reduce the risk of complications."
8,Can I prevent my baby from developing IVA?,<noinput>,"It is not possible to prevent IVA, but if you have a family history of the condition, further children can be tested and given appropriate treatment."
9,What should I do if my baby shows symptoms of a metabolic crisis?,<noinput>,"If your baby shows symptoms of a metabolic crisis, such as irritability, loss of energy, or breathing difficulties, seek medical help immediately."
0,What is isovaleric acidaemia (IVA)?,<noinput>,"Isovaleric acidaemia (IVA) is a rare inherited condition where the body cannot process the amino acid leucine, leading to a harmful build-up of isovaleric acid in the blood and urine."
1,How is IVA diagnosed?,<noinput>,"IVA can be diagnosed through newborn blood spot screening, which involves collecting drops of blood from the baby's heel. If IVA is detected, treatment can be started immediately to reduce the risk of complications."
2,What are the symptoms of IVA?,<noinput>,"The symptoms of IVA can vary but may include a distinctive odor resembling 'sweaty feet,' poor feeding, weight loss, lack of energy, vomiting, irritability, sleepiness, breathing difficulties, and metabolic crises characterized by floppiness and falling over."
3,How is IVA treated?,<noinput>,"Children with IVA are usually placed on a low-protein diet and may be prescribed medications such as L-carnitine or glycine to help clear excess isovaleric acid. In case of an infection or illness, emergency treatment instructions are provided to reduce the risk of a metabolic crisis."
4,How is IVA inherited?,<noinput>,"IVA is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning a person needs to inherit a mutated gene from both parents to develop the condition. If both parents are carriers, their child has a 1 in 4 chance of developing IVA, a 1 in 2 chance of being a carrier, and a 1 in 4 chance of receiving a pair of normal genes."
5,What is the treatment for IVA during an infection or illness?,<noinput>,"During an infection or illness, the treatment for IVA involves changing to an emergency diet, which replaces milk and protein-containing foods with special high-sugar drinks. Medications should still be taken as directed. In some cases, a feeding tube may be used if the baby is unable to feed properly."
6,How long does treatment for IVA need to be continued?,<noinput>,Treatment for IVA needs to be continued for life to reduce the risk of complications. Regular monitoring and follow-up with a dietitian are important to ensure the modified diet is properly maintained.
7,Can IVA be prevented?,<noinput>,"IVA cannot be prevented as it is an inherited condition. However, it is important for individuals with a family history of IVA to inform their healthcare providers, as further children can be tested for the condition and receive appropriate treatment."
8,Can you opt out of the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS)?,<noinput>,"Yes, you can opt out of the NCARDRS register at any time. The register helps scientists gather information to improve prevention and treatment of conditions like IVA."
9,Where can I find more information about NCARDRS?,<noinput>,You can find more information about the NCARDRS on the GOV.UK website.
