1,When should I seek medical advice for diabetes insipidus symptoms?,<noinput>,You should see your GP if you're feeling thirsty all the time or if you're peeing more than normal. It should be investigated to determine the cause.
2,What causes diabetes insipidus?,<noinput>,"Diabetes insipidus is caused by problems with a hormone called vasopressin (AVP) or antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which regulates fluid levels in the body."
3,How does diabetes insipidus affect the kidneys?,<noinput>,"In diabetes insipidus, the lack of production of vasopressin or the kidneys not responding to it causes the kidneys to produce too much diluted urine."
4,Who is affected by diabetes insipidus?,<noinput>,"Diabetes insipidus affects about 1 in 25,000 people in the general population and can occur at any age."
5,What are the types of diabetes insipidus?,<noinput>,There are two main types of diabetes insipidus: cranial diabetes insipidus and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
6,How is cranial diabetes insipidus caused?,<noinput>,"Cranial diabetes insipidus can be caused by damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland, as well as other factors like infections, tumors, or head injuries."
7,How is nephrogenic diabetes insipidus treated?,<noinput>,"Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is often treated with medications called thiazide diuretics, which reduce the amount of urine produced by the kidneys."
8,What are the complications of diabetes insipidus?,<noinput>,Diabetes insipidus can lead to dehydration due to increased water loss in the urine. Severe dehydration may require treatment in a hospital.
9,How can mild cases of cranial diabetes insipidus be managed?,<noinput>,Mild cases of cranial diabetes insipidus can be managed by increasing water intake to compensate for the lost fluids through frequent urination.
0,What are the main symptoms of diabetes insipidus?,<noinput>,The main symptoms of diabetes insipidus are extreme thirst (polydipsia) and excessive urination (polyuria).
1,When should I seek medical advice for diabetes insipidus?,<noinput>,You should see your GP if you're experiencing constant thirst or urinating more than normal.

5,What are the types of diabetes insipidus?,<noinput>,There are two main types of diabetes insipidus: cranial diabetes insipidus and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
6,How is cranial diabetes insipidus caused?,<noinput>,"Cranial diabetes insipidus can be caused by damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland, brain tumors, infections, operations, or head injuries."
7,How is nephrogenic diabetes insipidus caused?,<noinput>,"Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus occurs when the body has sufficient AVP, but the kidneys fail to respond to it. It can be caused by kidney damage, inherited problems, or certain medications."
8,How is diabetes insipidus treated?,<noinput>,"Treatment for diabetes insipidus may include increasing fluid intake, medication like desmopressin to replicate AVP functions, and thiazide diuretics to reduce urine production."
9,What are the complications of diabetes insipidus?,<noinput>,"Diabetes insipidus can lead to dehydration due to excessive water loss in urine. Mild cases can be treated with rehydration, while severe cases may require hospital treatment."
