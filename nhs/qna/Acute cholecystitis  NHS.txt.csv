0,What is acute cholecystitis?,<noinput>,"Acute cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder, usually caused by a gallstone blocking the cystic duct."
1,What are the symptoms of acute cholecystitis?,<noinput>,"The main symptom is a sudden, sharp pain in the upper right-hand side of the abdomen that spreads to the right shoulder. Other symptoms may include fever, nausea, vomiting, sweating, loss of appetite, jaundice, and a bulge in the abdomen."
2,When should I seek medical advice for acute cholecystitis?,<noinput>,"You should see a GP as soon as possible if you develop sudden and severe abdominal pain, especially if it lasts longer than a few hours or is accompanied by symptoms such as jaundice and a high temperature."
3,What causes acute cholecystitis?,<noinput>,"Acute cholecystitis can be caused by gallstones blocking the cystic duct (calculous cholecystitis) or inflammation without gallstones (acalculous cholecystitis). Calculous cholecystitis is more common, while acalculous cholecystitis is usually a complication of another illness or injury."
4,How is acute cholecystitis diagnosed?,<noinput>,"A GP may perform a test called Murphy's sign, where pressure is applied to the abdomen to check for pain. Further tests may include blood tests to check for inflammation and an ultrasound scan to look for gallstones or other issues."
5,What is the treatment for acute cholecystitis?,<noinput>,"Treatment often involves fasting, receiving fluids intravenously, and taking pain medication. Antibiotics may be given if there is an infection. Surgery to remove the gallbladder may be recommended to prevent future episodes and complications."
6,What are the possible complications of acute cholecystitis?,<noinput>,"Without treatment, acute cholecystitis can lead to serious complications such as tissue death in the gallbladder or a perforated gallbladder. Emergency surgery may be required in these cases."
7,How can I prevent acute cholecystitis?,<noinput>,"Reducing the risk of gallstones can lower the chances of developing acute cholecystitis. This can be done by adopting a healthy, balanced diet, reducing high-cholesterol foods, controlling weight through diet and exercise, and avoiding low-calorie rapid weight loss diets."
8,What is the role of the gallbladder?,<noinput>,"The gallbladder stores and concentrates bile, a liquid produced by the liver that helps digest fats. It releases bile into the digestive system when needed. Although useful, the gallbladder is not essential and can be safely removed without affecting digestion."
0,What are the symptoms of acute cholecystitis?,<noinput>,"The main symptom of acute cholecystitis is a sudden, sharp pain in the upper right-hand side of the abdomen. The pain may spread towards the right shoulder. Other symptoms may include a high temperature, feeling sick, being sick, sweating, loss of appetite, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), and a bulge in the abdomen."
1,When should I seek medical advice for acute cholecystitis?,<noinput>,"You should see a GP as soon as possible if you develop sudden and severe abdominal pain, particularly if it lasts longer than a few hours or is accompanied by other symptoms such as jaundice and a high temperature. If you're unable to contact a GP immediately, phone your local out-of-hours service or call NHS 111 for advice."
2,What causes acute cholecystitis?,<noinput>,"Acute cholecystitis can be caused by gallstones blocking the cystic duct (calculous cholecystitis) or inflammation without gallstones (acalculous cholecystitis). Calculous cholecystitis accounts for about 95% of all cases and is caused by gallstones or biliary sludge blocking the cystic duct. Acalculous cholecystitis is usually a complication of a serious illness, infection, or injury that damages the gallbladder."
3,How is acute cholecystitis diagnosed?,<noinput>,"If you have severe tummy pain, a GP will probably carry out a simple test called Murphy's sign. Further tests and imaging may include blood tests to check for signs of inflammation and an ultrasound scan of the abdomen to check for gallstones or other problems with the gallbladder."
4,What is the initial treatment for acute cholecystitis?,<noinput>,"Initial treatment may involve fasting, receiving fluids through a drip, and taking pain medication. Antibiotics may also be given if there is a suspected infection. In some cases, surgery to remove the gallbladder may be recommended after the initial treatment to prevent recurrent acute cholecystitis and reduce the risk of complications."
5,What are the main types of surgery for cholecystectomy?,<noinput>,"There are two main types of surgery for cholecystectomy: open cholecystectomy, where the gallbladder is removed through a single cut in the tummy, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which is a minimally invasive procedure using special surgical instruments inserted through small cuts in the abdomen."
6,What are the possible complications of acute cholecystitis?,<noinput>,"Without treatment, acute cholecystitis can lead to serious complications such as gangrenous cholecystitis (death of gallbladder tissue) and perforated gallbladder (gallbladder splitting open), which can cause infection and peritonitis. Emergency surgery is needed to treat these complications."
7,How can acute cholecystitis be prevented?,<noinput>,"Although it's not always possible to prevent acute cholecystitis, you can lower your risk by reducing the chances of developing gallstones. This can be done by adopting a healthy, balanced diet, reducing high-cholesterol foods, controlling weight, and avoiding low-calorie rapid weight loss diets."
8,What is the function and significance of the gallbladder?,<noinput>,"The gallbladder is a small pear-shaped organ located beneath the liver. Its main purpose is to store and concentrate bile, a liquid produced by the liver to help digest fats. The gallbladder releases bile into the digestive system when needed. It is not essential for digestion and can be safely removed if necessary."
9,What is acalculous cholecystitis?,<noinput>,"Acalculous cholecystitis is gallbladder inflammation without gallstones. It is less common but usually more serious than calculous cholecystitis. The exact cause is not known, but it is usually a complication of a serious illness, infection, or injury that damages the gallbladder."

2,What are the causes of acute cholecystitis?,<noinput>,"Acute cholecystitis can be caused by calculous cholecystitis, which happens when the cystic duct gets blocked by a gallstone or biliary sludge. It can also be caused by acalculous cholecystitis, which is inflammation of the gallbladder without gallstones, usually a complication of a serious illness, infection, or injury."
3,How is acute cholecystitis diagnosed?,<noinput>,"If you have severe abdominal pain, a GP may perform a test called Murphy's sign. Further tests that may be done in the hospital include blood tests to check for signs of inflammation and an ultrasound scan of the abdomen to look for gallstones or other issues with the gallbladder."
4,What is the treatment for acute cholecystitis?,<noinput>,"Initial treatment usually involves fasting, receiving fluids intravenously, and taking pain medication. Antibiotics may be given if there is an infection. Surgery to remove the gallbladder, known as cholecystectomy, may be recommended after initial treatment to prevent future episodes and reduce complications. There are open and laparoscopic options, and sometimes a drainage procedure may be done instead of surgery."
5,What complications can occur with acute cholecystitis?,<noinput>,"Without prompt treatment, acute cholecystitis can lead to complications such as gangrenous cholecystitis, which can cause a serious infection, and perforated gallbladder, which can lead to peritonitis or abscess. Emergency surgery is often required in these cases."
6,How can I prevent acute cholecystitis?,<noinput>,"While it may not always be preventable, you can lower your risk of developing acute cholecystitis by reducing your risk of gallstones. This can be done by adopting a healthy, balanced diet, reducing high-cholesterol foods, maintaining a healthy weight through diet and exercise, and avoiding rapid weight loss diets."
7,What is the function of the gallbladder?,<noinput>,"The gallbladder is a small pear-shaped organ located beneath the liver. Its main function is to store and concentrate bile, which is produced by the liver. Bile helps digest fats and carries toxins excreted by the liver. The gallbladder releases bile into the digestive system when needed."
