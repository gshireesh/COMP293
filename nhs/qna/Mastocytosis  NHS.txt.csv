0,What are the 2 main types of mastocytosis?,<noinput>,The 2 main types of mastocytosis are cutaneous mastocytosis and systemic mastocytosis.
1,How do mast cells contribute to the immune system?,<noinput>,Mast cells are an important part of the immune system and help fight infections by releasing histamine and other chemicals when they detect an allergen.
2,What are the symptoms of cutaneous mastocytosis?,<noinput>,The most common symptom of cutaneous mastocytosis is the presence of abnormal growths (lesions) on the skin such as bumps and spots.
3,What triggers episodes of severe symptoms in systemic mastocytosis?,<noinput>,Episodes of severe symptoms in systemic mastocytosis can be triggered by factors such as physical exertion or stress.
4,What are the 3 main subtypes of systemic mastocytosis?,<noinput>,"The 3 main subtypes of systemic mastocytosis are indolent systemic mastocytosis, aggressive mastocytosis, and systemic mastocytosis with associated blood (haematological) disease."
5,What is anaphylaxis and why are individuals with mastocytosis at increased risk?,<noinput>,Anaphylaxis is a severe and life-threatening allergic reaction. Individuals with mastocytosis are at an increased risk of anaphylaxis due to the abnormally high number of mast cells and their potential to release large amounts of histamine into the blood.
6,What is the cause of mastocytosis?,<noinput>,"The cause of mastocytosis is not fully known, but there is an association with a change in genes known as the KIT mutation."
7,What tests are used to diagnose cutaneous mastocytosis?,<noinput>,A physical examination and biopsy are commonly used to diagnose cutaneous mastocytosis.
8,How is indolent systemic mastocytosis usually diagnosed?,<noinput>,A diagnosis of indolent systemic mastocytosis is usually made by finding typical changes on a bone marrow biopsy.
9,What is the aim of treatment for mastocytosis?,<noinput>,The aim of treatment for mastocytosis is to try to relieve the symptoms as there is no cure for the condition.
0,What are the main types of mastocytosis?,<noinput>,The main types of mastocytosis are cutaneous mastocytosis and systemic mastocytosis.
1,What are mast cells and what do they do?,<noinput>,Mast cells are produced in the bone marrow and play an important role in the immune system. They release histamine and other chemicals to fight infection and can trigger allergic reactions.
2,What are the symptoms of cutaneous mastocytosis?,<noinput>,"The most common symptom of cutaneous mastocytosis is abnormal growths (lesions) on the skin, such as bumps and spots."
3,What are the symptoms of systemic mastocytosis?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of systemic mastocytosis can include skin reactions, gut symptoms, muscle and joint pain, mood changes, headaches, and fatigue."
4,What is the cause of mastocytosis?,<noinput>,"The exact cause of mastocytosis is not fully known, but there is an association with a genetic mutation known as the KIT mutation."
5,How is mastocytosis diagnosed?,<noinput>,"Diagnosis of cutaneous mastocytosis can be done through a physical examination and biopsy. Systemic mastocytosis can be diagnosed through blood tests, ultrasound scans, DEXA scans, and bone marrow biopsy."
6,Is there a cure for mastocytosis?,<noinput>,"There is no cure for mastocytosis, but treatment aims to relieve the symptoms."
7,How can cutaneous mastocytosis be treated?,<noinput>,Mild to moderate cases of cutaneous mastocytosis can be treated with steroid cream. Antihistamines can also be used to treat symptoms.
8,What are the complications of mastocytosis?,<noinput>,"In children, cutaneous mastocytosis usually improves over time. The outlook for systemic mastocytosis can vary, with indolent systemic mastocytosis having a good prognosis, while other types may affect life expectancy."
9,How can anaphylaxis be managed in people with mastocytosis?,<noinput>,People with mastocytosis may need to carry an adrenaline auto-injector to manage severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis.
