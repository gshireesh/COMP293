0,What are tendons?,<noinput>,"Tendons are tough cords of tissue that connect muscles to bones, allowing you to make a wide range of movements in your hand."
1,When is hand tendon repair needed?,<noinput>,"Hand tendon repair is needed when one or more tendons in your hand rupture or are cut, leading to the loss of normal hand movements. It can be caused by cuts, sports injuries, animal bites, crushing injuries, or rheumatoid arthritis."
2,How is tendon repair surgery performed?,<noinput>,"Tendon repair surgery involves making a cut in your wrist, hand, or finger to locate the ends of the divided tendon and stitch them back together. It is relatively straightforward to repair extensor tendons."
3,How long does it take to recover from tendon repair surgery?,<noinput>,"Recovery from tendon repair surgery can take up to 3 months for the repaired tendon to regain its previous strength. It involves wearing a hand splint, performing hand exercises, and gradually resuming light activities after 6 to 8 weeks."
4,What are the results of tendon repair surgery?,<noinput>,"After tendon repair surgery, you may regain working fingers or thumb, but full movement may not be achieved. The outcome is often better with clean cuts to the tendon, compared to crushing injuries or damage to bones and joints."
5,Can complications occur after tendon repair surgery?,<noinput>,"Complications such as infection, repaired tendon snapping, or sticking to nearby tissue can occur after tendon repair surgery. In such cases, further treatment may be required."
6,What are the causes of tendon injuries in the hand?,<noinput>,"Tendon injuries in the hand can be caused by cuts, sports injuries, animal bites, crushing injuries, or rheumatoid arthritis."
7,How can hand tendon injuries be treated without surgery?,<noinput>,"Sometimes, damage to the extensor tendons in the hand can be treated without surgery using a rigid support called a splint."
8,How long should a hand splint be worn after tendon repair surgery?,<noinput>,"After tendon repair surgery, a hand splint is usually worn for several weeks to protect the tendons from overuse and promote proper healing."
9,When can heavy activities and sports be resumed after tendon repair surgery?,<noinput>,Heavy activities and sports can often be resumed after 10 to 12 weeks of recovery from tendon repair surgery.

2,What are common causes of tendon injuries?,<noinput>,"Common causes of tendon injuries include cuts, sports injuries, animal and human bites, crushing injuries, and rheumatoid arthritis."
3,How is tendon repair surgery performed?,<noinput>,"Tendon repair surgery may involve making a cut in the wrist, hand, or finger to locate the ends of the divided tendon and stitch them together."
4,What is the recovery process after tendon repair surgery?,<noinput>,"Recovery from tendon repair surgery involves a lengthy period of rehabilitation, wearing a hand splint, and performing hand exercises regularly. It can take up to 3 months for the repaired tendon to regain its strength."
5,What are the results of tendon repair surgery?,<noinput>,"After tendon repair surgery, the outcome varies. Full movement may not be regained, but the repaired tendon generally provides a better result than not having surgery."
6,What complications can occur after tendon repair surgery?,<noinput>,"Complications can include infection or the repaired tendon snapping or sticking to nearby tissue, which may require further treatment."
7,How long does it take to return to work after tendon repair surgery?,<noinput>,"The time to return to work depends on the job. Light activities can be resumed after 6 to 8 weeks, while heavy activities and sports can be resumed after 10 to 12 weeks."
8,What is the difference in outcome between extensor and flexor tendon repairs?,<noinput>,"After an extensor tendon repair, a working finger or thumb is expected, but full movement may not be regained. Flexor tendon injuries are generally more serious, and some fingers may not regain full movement after repair."
