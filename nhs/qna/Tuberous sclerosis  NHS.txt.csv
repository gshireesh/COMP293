1,What causes tuberous sclerosis?,<noinput>,"Tuberous sclerosis is caused by mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 gene, which leads to uncontrolled growth and multiple tumors throughout the body. In most cases, the genetic fault occurs randomly, while in some cases, it is inherited from parents."
2,How is tuberous sclerosis treated?,<noinput>,"While there is no cure for tuberous sclerosis, various treatments can help manage its symptoms. These include medication for epilepsy, surgical removal or shrinking of brain tumors, behavioral interventions and medication for psychiatric problems, laser therapy or topical medication for the facial rash, and medication to control kidney function and shrink kidney tumors."
3,What is the outlook for people with tuberous sclerosis?,<noinput>,"The outlook for people with tuberous sclerosis can vary. Some have minimal symptoms, while others experience severe and potentially life-threatening problems. While many can lead a normal lifespan, complications like loss of kidney function, lung infections, and severe epileptic seizures can occur."
4,Where can individuals and families affected by tuberous sclerosis find support?,<noinput>,"The Tuberous Sclerosis Association (TSA) provides information, advice, and support to individuals and families affected by tuberous sclerosis. They offer an online community and specialist advisers."
5,What are the features of tuberous sclerosis?,<noinput>,"Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic condition that causes benign tumors to develop in different parts of the body. The tumors can affect the brain, skin, kidneys, heart, eyes, and lungs. Other features include epilepsy, learning disabilities, skin abnormalities, and hydrocephalus."
6,Can tuberous sclerosis be inherited from parents?,<noinput>,"Yes, tuberous sclerosis can be inherited from parents. If one parent carries the faulty TSC1 or TSC2 gene, there is a 1 in 2 chance of passing it on to their child."
7,What are the potential complications of tuberous sclerosis?,<noinput>,"Some potential complications of tuberous sclerosis include loss of kidney function, lung infections, and severe epileptic seizures. There is also a rare increased risk of developing certain types of cancer, such as kidney cancer."
8,Are there any specific treatments that may be useful in the future for tuberous sclerosis?,<noinput>,"Research has found that mTOR inhibitors, a type of medicine that interrupts the chemical reactions needed for tumor growth, may be a useful treatment for tuberous sclerosis in the future."
