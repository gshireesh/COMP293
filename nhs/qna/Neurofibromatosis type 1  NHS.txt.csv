0,What are the symptoms of neurofibromatosis type 1?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of neurofibromatosis type 1 include café au lait spots, neurofibromas, and freckles in unusual places. It can also cause problems with the bones, eyes, and nervous system."
1,What causes neurofibromatosis type 1?,<noinput>,Neurofibromatosis type 1 is caused by a faulty gene. It can be inherited from a parent or develop spontaneously.
2,How is neurofibromatosis type 1 diagnosed?,<noinput>,"NF1 can be diagnosed by checking for typical symptoms. Further tests such as scans, blood tests, or a biopsy may be recommended for confirmation."
3,Is there a cure for neurofibromatosis type 1?,<noinput>,"Currently, there is no cure for NF1. Treatment involves regular monitoring, treating symptoms, and managing secondary conditions."
4,What are the risks of neurofibromatosis type 1 in pregnancy?,<noinput>,Pregnancy may cause an increase in neurofibromas due to hormonal changes. Make sure to consult with an obstetrician knowledgeable about NF1.
5,Are there any support charities for neurofibromatosis?,<noinput>,Nerve Tumours UK and the Childhood Tumour Trust provide information and support for people affected by neurofibromatosis.
6,What are the screening recommendations for women with NF1 and breast cancer?,<noinput>,Women with NF1 under 50 years old have an increased risk of breast cancer and should start having breast screening appointments at 40 years old.
7,Does having NF1 information benefit scientific research?,<noinput>,"If you or your child has NF1, your clinical team will pass on information to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) to aid scientific research."
8,Can NF1 be inherited?,<noinput>,"In half of all cases, NF1 is inherited from a parent. If one parent has the faulty gene, there's a 1 in 2 chance of the child developing NF1."
9,How can NF1 be treated?,<noinput>,"Treatment for NF1 involves surgery to remove tumours, medication to control secondary conditions, physiotherapy, and pain management."
0,What are the symptoms of neurofibromatosis type 1?,<noinput>,"The symptoms of neurofibromatosis type 1 include birthmarks known as café au lait spots, soft tumors on or under the skin (neurofibromas), clusters of freckles in unusual places, and problems with the bones, eyes, and nervous system."
1,What causes neurofibromatosis type 1?,<noinput>,Neurofibromatosis type 1 is caused by a faulty gene. It can be inherited from a parent or develop spontaneously without family history.
2,How is neurofibromatosis type 1 diagnosed?,<noinput>,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 can be diagnosed by checking for typical symptoms. Further tests such as scans, blood tests, or a biopsy may be recommended for confirmation."
3,What are the treatment options for neurofibromatosis type 1?,<noinput>,"There is currently no cure for neurofibromatosis type 1. Treatment involves regular monitoring, surgeries to remove tumors and treat bone problems, medication for secondary conditions, physiotherapy, psychological support, and pain management."
4,"If I have neurofibromatosis type 1, can I have a healthy pregnancy?",<noinput>,"Yes, you can have a healthy pregnancy if you have neurofibromatosis type 1. However, hormone changes may increase the number of neurofibromas, so it's important to consult with an obstetrician or your neurofibromatosis specialist."
5,Are there any charities that provide support for neurofibromatosis?,<noinput>,"Yes, Nerve Tumours UK and the Childhood Tumour Trust provide information and support for people with neurofibromatosis."
6,Do women with neurofibromatosis type 1 have an increased risk of breast cancer?,<noinput>,"Yes, women under 50 with neurofibromatosis type 1 have an increased risk of breast cancer and should start having breast screening appointments at 40 years old."
7,What is the role of the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service?,<noinput>,The National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) collects information from clinical teams to help scientists find better ways to prevent and treat neurofibromatosis type 1.
8,How can I opt out of the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service register?,<noinput>,You can opt out of the register by contacting the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) at any time.
0,What are the symptoms of neurofibromatosis type 1?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of neurofibromatosis type 1 include café au lait spots, neurofibromas, freckles in unusual places, and problems with bones, eyes, and the nervous system."
1,How is neurofibromatosis type 1 diagnosed?,<noinput>,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 can be diagnosed by checking for typical symptoms in adults and older children. Further tests such as scans, blood tests, or a biopsy may be done to confirm the diagnosis."
2,What causes neurofibromatosis type 1?,<noinput>,Neurofibromatosis type 1 is caused by a faulty gene. It can be inherited from a parent or develop spontaneously.
3,How is neurofibromatosis type 1 treated?,<noinput>,"There is currently no cure for neurofibromatosis type 1. Treatment involves regular monitoring and addressing any problems as they arise, such as surgery, medication, physiotherapy, and psychological support."
4,What is the risk of breast cancer in women with neurofibromatosis type 1?,<noinput>,Women under 50 with neurofibromatosis type 1 have an increased risk of breast cancer and should start having breast screening appointments at age 40.
5,Is neurofibromatosis type 1 a genetic condition?,<noinput>,"Yes, neurofibromatosis type 1 is a genetic condition caused by a faulty gene."
6,Are there any charities that provide support for people with neurofibromatosis?,<noinput>,"Yes, Nerve Tumours UK and the Childhood Tumour Trust provide information and support for individuals and families affected by neurofibromatosis."
7,What is the role of the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) in neurofibromatosis?,<noinput>,The NCARDRS collects information about individuals with neurofibromatosis to help researchers find better ways to prevent and treat the condition.
8,Can neurofibromatosis type 1 affect a pregnancy?,<noinput>,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 does not have a significant impact on pregnancy, although the number of neurofibromas may increase due to hormonal changes."
9,How can neurofibromatosis type 1 be prevented?,<noinput>,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 cannot be prevented as it is a genetic condition. However, couples with a family history of NF1 may consider genetic counseling and discuss options such as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis or adoption."
