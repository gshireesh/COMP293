3,How successful is vitrectomy surgery for closing a macular hole?,<noinput>,Vitrectomy surgery is successful in closing the macular hole in about 9 out of 10 people who have had the hole for less than 6 months. The success rate may be lower for holes present for a year or longer.
4,What does vitrectomy surgery involve?,<noinput>,"During vitrectomy surgery, small incisions are made in the eye, the vitreous jelly is removed, and the inner limiting membrane is carefully peeled off the retina. The hole is then sealed using a gas bubble."
5,What can I expect after vitrectomy surgery?,<noinput>,"After vitrectomy surgery, you may experience temporary poor vision, mild pain or discomfort, and will need to take medication and care for your eye at home. Your ophthalmologist will provide specific instructions."
6,Do I need to position myself face down after macular hole surgery?,<noinput>,Face-down positioning may be necessary after macular hole surgery to encourage the hole to close. Your doctor will advise you on whether or not you need to do this.
7,Can I travel after macular hole surgery?,<noinput>,You must avoid flying or traveling to high altitudes while the gas bubble is still in your eye. Doing so can cause high pressure inside the eye and potentially permanent loss of vision.
8,Can I drive after macular hole surgery?,<noinput>,You probably won't be able to drive for 6 to 8 weeks after the surgery while the gas bubble is still present in your eye. Consult with your specialist for specific guidance.
9,What are the possible complications of macular hole surgery?,<noinput>,"Possible complications of macular hole surgery include failure to close the hole, cataract formation, retinal detachment, bleeding, infection, and increased pressure within the eye."
