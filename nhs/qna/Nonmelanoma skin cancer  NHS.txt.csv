0,What are the symptoms of non-melanoma skin cancer?,<noinput>,"The symptoms of non-melanoma skin cancer include the appearance of a lump or discolored patch on the skin that persists for a few weeks and slowly progresses over months or years. Cancerous lumps are usually red and firm, while cancerous patches are flat and scaly."
1,When should I seek medical advice for a skin abnormality?,<noinput>,"If you have any skin abnormality, such as a lump, ulcer, lesion, or skin discoloration that has not healed after 4 weeks, it's best to see a GP and get it checked."
2,What are the types of non-melanoma skin cancer?,<noinput>,"The two most common types of non-melanoma skin cancer are basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). BCC starts in the cells lining the bottom of the epidermis, while SCC starts in the cells lining the top of the epidermis."
3,What are the characteristics of basal cell carcinoma (BCC)?,<noinput>,"Basal cell carcinoma usually appears as a small, shiny pink or pearly-white lump with a translucent or waxy appearance. It can also look like a red, scaly patch. The lump slowly gets bigger and may become crusty, bleed, or develop into a painless ulcer."
4,How does squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) appear?,<noinput>,"Squamous cell carcinoma appears as a firm pink lump with a rough or crusted surface. There can be a lot of surface scale, and sometimes even a spiky horn sticking up from the surface. The lump often feels tender when touched, bleeds easily, and may develop into an ulcer."
5,What is Bowen's disease?,<noinput>,"Bowen's disease is a precancerous form of squamous cell carcinoma. It appears as a red, scaly patch on the skin that may itch. Although not classified as non-melanoma skin cancer, Bowen's disease can sometimes develop into SCC if left untreated."
6,What are actinic keratoses?,<noinput>,"Actinic keratoses, also known as solar keratoses, are dry, scaly patches of skin caused by damage from years of sun exposure. The patches can be pink, red, or brown and can vary in size. There's a small risk that actinic keratoses could develop into SCC if untreated."
7,What are the main causes of non-melanoma skin cancer?,<noinput>,"The main cause of non-melanoma skin cancer is overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun and artificial tanning sources. Other risk factors include a previous non-melanoma skin cancer, a family history of skin cancer, pale skin, a large number of moles or freckles, taking medication that suppresses the immune system, and certain medical conditions that suppress the immune system."
8,How is non-melanoma skin cancer diagnosed?,<noinput>,"A GP can examine your skin for signs of skin cancer and may refer you to a skin specialist or specialist plastic surgeon for further evaluation. They may perform a biopsy, where a sample of the affected skin is taken and analyzed to confirm a diagnosis of skin cancer."
9,What are the treatment options for non-melanoma skin cancer?,<noinput>,"Surgery is the main treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer, which involves removing the cancerous tumor and some surrounding skin. Other treatments include freezing (cryotherapy), anti-cancer creams, radiotherapy, and photodynamic therapy (PDT). The treatment used depends on the type, size, and location of the skin cancer."

3,What causes non-melanoma skin cancer?,<noinput>,"The main cause of non-melanoma skin cancer is overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, which can come from the sun or artificial tanning sunbeds and sunlamps. Other risk factors include a previous non-melanoma skin cancer, family history, pale skin, a large number of moles or freckles, taking immune-suppressing medicine, or having a co-existing medical condition that suppresses the immune system."

6,Are there complications associated with non-melanoma skin cancer?,<noinput>,"There is a chance that non-melanoma skin cancer may return, especially if the previous cancer was large and severe. Regular check-ups may be required to monitor your health. Additionally, having a history of non-melanoma skin cancer increases the risk of developing another one in the future."
7,How can I prevent non-melanoma skin cancer?,<noinput>,"While not always preventable, you can reduce your chances of developing non-melanoma skin cancer by avoiding overexposure to UV light. This includes using sunscreen, dressing sensibly in the sun, avoiding sunbeds and sunlamps, and regularly checking your skin for signs of skin cancer."
8,What is basal cell carcinoma (BCC)?,<noinput>,"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is a type of non-melanoma skin cancer that usually appears as a small, shiny pink or pearly-white lump. It can also look like a red, scaly patch and slowly grows bigger over time. BCC does not usually spread to other parts of the body."
9,What is squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)?,<noinput>,"Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is another type of non-melanoma skin cancer that appears as a firm pink lump with a rough or crusted surface. It can be tender, easily bleed, and may develop into an ulcer. There is a small risk of SCC spreading to other parts of the body, such as the lymph nodes."
