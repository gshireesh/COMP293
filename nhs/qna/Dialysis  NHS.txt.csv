0,Why do I need dialysis?,<noinput>,"If your kidneys are not working properly – for example, because you have advanced chronic kidney disease (kidney failure) – the kidneys may not be able to clean the blood properly. Waste products and fluid can build up to dangerous levels in your body. Left untreated, this can cause a number of unpleasant symptoms and eventually be fatal. Dialysis filters out unwanted substances and fluids from the blood before this happens."
1,How long will I need dialysis for?,<noinput>,"It depends. In some cases, kidney failure may be a temporary problem and dialysis can be stopped when your kidneys recover. But often, someone with kidney failure will need a kidney transplant. It's not always possible to carry out a kidney transplant straight away, so dialysis may be needed until a suitable donor kidney becomes available. If a kidney transplant is not suitable for you – for example, because you're not well enough to have a major operation – dialysis may be needed for the rest of your life."
2,What happens during dialysis?,<noinput>,"There are 2 main types of dialysis: haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Haemodialysis involves diverting blood to a machine to be cleaned, while peritoneal dialysis uses the lining of your abdomen as a filter. Both methods help remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood."
3,Which type of dialysis is best?,<noinput>,"In many cases, you'll be able to choose which type of dialysis you want to have and where to have it. The 2 techniques, haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, are equally effective for most people, but each has its own advantages and drawbacks. Your care team will discuss the pros and cons of each option with you to help you make a decision."
4,What are the side effects of dialysis?,<noinput>,"Haemodialysis can cause itchy skin and muscle cramps, while peritoneal dialysis can put you at risk of developing peritonitis. Both types of dialysis can make you feel exhausted. It's important to be aware of these potential side effects and report any concerns to your healthcare team."
5,What is life like on dialysis?,<noinput>,"Many people on dialysis have a good quality of life. If you're otherwise well, you can continue working or studying, drive, exercise, go swimming, and even go on holiday. It's important to follow your treatment plan and take care of your overall health while on dialysis."

2,What happens during dialysis?,<noinput>,There are 2 main types of dialysis: haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.Haemodialysis involves attaching a tube to a needle in your arm and passing the blood through an external machine that filters it before returning it to your arm. Peritoneal dialysis uses the lining of your abdomen to filter the blood instead of a machine. A catheter is inserted into your abdomen and fluid is pumped in and out to draw out waste products and excess fluid.
3,Which type of dialysis is best?,<noinput>,"The choice between haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis depends on your preferences and medical needs. Haemodialysis typically involves longer treatment sessions but fewer days of treatment, while peritoneal dialysis can be done at home and allows for daily treatment. Your healthcare team can discuss the pros and cons of each option with you to help you make a decision."
4,What are the side effects of dialysis?,<noinput>,"Haemodialysis can cause itchy skin and muscle cramps, while peritoneal dialysis can put you at risk of developing peritonitis. Both types can make you feel exhausted. It's important to be aware of and manage these side effects with the help of your healthcare team."
5,What is life like on dialysis?,<noinput>,"Many people on dialysis have a good quality of life. With proper management, you can continue working or studying, drive, exercise, go swimming, and even go on holiday. However, dialysis can only partially compensate for the loss of kidney function, so a kidney transplant may be necessary for long-term survival."
6,Can people die while on dialysis?,<noinput>,"While dialysis can prolong life, it is not a permanent solution. People on dialysis without a kidney transplant, especially older individuals and those with other health problems, may be at a higher risk of mortality. However, survival rates on dialysis have improved over the years and are expected to continue improving in the future."
7,What are the advantages and disadvantages of haemodialysis?,<noinput>,"One advantage of haemodialysis is having treatment-free days, but the sessions can be longer and require visits to the hospital. Home haemodialysis offers more flexibility but requires more frequent sessions. Some disadvantages include itchy skin, muscle cramps, and feeling exhausted."
8,What are the advantages and disadvantages of peritoneal dialysis?,<noinput>,"Peritoneal dialysis can be done at home and allows for daily treatment, and in some cases, it can be done while you sleep. However, it needs to be done every day, and there is a risk of developing peritonitis. It's important to weigh these pros and cons when considering peritoneal dialysis."
9,What are the possible complications of dialysis?,<noinput>,"Complications of dialysis can include infections, blood clots, low blood pressure, and electrolyte imbalances. It's crucial to work closely with your healthcare team to monitor and manage these complications to ensure the best possible outcome."

2,What happens during dialysis?,<noinput>,"There are 2 main types of dialysis: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis involves attaching a tube to a needle in your arm and diverting blood to a machine that filters it. Peritoneal dialysis uses the lining of your abdomen as the filter. Fluid is pumped into the abdominal cavity, waste products and excess fluid are drawn out, and the used fluid is drained and replaced. Dialysis can be done at a dialysis center or at home."

4,What are the side effects of dialysis?,<noinput>,"Hemodialysis can cause itchy skin and muscle cramps. Peritoneal dialysis can put you at risk of developing peritonitis, an infection of the thin membrane that surrounds your abdomen. Both types of dialysis can make you feel exhausted."
5,What can I do while on dialysis?,<noinput>,"Many people on dialysis have a good quality of life. If you're otherwise well, you should be able to continue working or studying, drive, exercise, go swimming, and go on holiday. Most people can remain on dialysis for many years, although the treatment can only partially compensate for the loss of kidney function."
6,What are the survival rates for people on dialysis?,<noinput>,"Someone who starts dialysis in their late 20s can expect to live for up to 20 years or longer, but adults over 75 may only survive for 2 to 3 years. However, survival rates of people on dialysis have improved over the past decade and are expected to continue improving in the future."
7,Can dialysis be stopped once the kidneys recover?,<noinput>,"Yes, if kidney failure is a temporary problem and your kidneys recover, dialysis can be stopped. However, in many cases, someone with kidney failure will need a kidney transplant to fully regain kidney function."
8,Can dialysis be done at home?,<noinput>,"Yes, both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis can be done at home. Home dialysis allows for more flexibility in treatment schedules and can be more convenient for some individuals."
9,What is peritoneal dialysis?,<noinput>,"Peritoneal dialysis is a type of dialysis that uses the lining of your abdomen (the peritoneum) as the filter. A catheter is inserted into your abdomen, and dialysis fluid is pumped into the peritoneal cavity. Waste products and excess fluid are drawn out of the blood vessels lining the peritoneal cavity and into the dialysis fluid, which is drained and replaced multiple times a day."
