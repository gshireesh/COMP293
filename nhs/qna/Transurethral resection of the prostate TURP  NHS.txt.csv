Your doctor will discuss which option is suitable for you."
6,What is retrograde ejaculation?,<noinput>,Retrograde ejaculation is when semen is ejaculated into the bladder instead of out through the penis. It can be a possible complication of TURP.

4,What are the alternatives to TURP?,<noinput>,"Alternatives to TURP include PLASMA system, holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP), transurethral laser resection or vaporisation of the prostate, and prostatic urethral lift (PUL) implants."
5,How does the PLASMA system work?,<noinput>,The PLASMA system involves electrodes that are put into the prostate through the urethra to cut out prostate tissue.
6,What is holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP)?,<noinput>,HoLEP is a procedure where a laser attached to a resectoscope is used to cut away excess prostate tissue.
7,How does transurethral laser resection or vaporisation of the prostate work?,<noinput>,"Transurethral laser resection or vaporisation of the prostate involves a thin tube called a cystoscope inserted into the urethra, and a laser attached to the cystoscope fires pulses of energy to burn away prostate tissue."
8,What are prostatic urethral lift (PUL) implants?,<noinput>,"PUL implants are implants that hold the enlarged prostate away from the urethra, relieving symptoms like pain or difficulty when peeing."
