1,What factors determine which type of refractive surgery is best for you?,<noinput>,"The factors that determine which type of refractive surgery is best for you include your eyesight, eye health, age, budget, and lifestyle."
2,What is laser eye surgery and what vision problems can it correct?,<noinput>,"Laser eye surgery, or laser vision correction, uses lasers to reshape the cornea and can correct short-sightedness, long-sightedness, and astigmatism."
3,Is laser eye surgery suitable for everyone?,<noinput>,"Laser eye surgery is suitable for most people over 18, if their eye prescription has remained stable for about 2 years. Lens surgery may be more suitable for those with high spectacle prescriptions or later in life."
4,What are the 3 main types of laser eye surgery?,<noinput>,"The 3 main types of laser eye surgery are LASIK, SMILE, and surface laser treatments (PRK, LASEK, and TransPRK)."
5,What are the common side effects of laser eye surgery?,<noinput>,"Common side effects of laser eye surgery include mild discomfort, visual disturbances (such as glare at night), and temporary red marks on the white of the eye."
6,What is phakic intraocular lens (PIOL) surgery?,<noinput>,Phakic intraocular lens (PIOL) surgery involves placing artificial lenses inside the eyes without removing the natural lenses.
7,Who is phakic intraocular lens (PIOL) surgery suitable for?,<noinput>,PIOL surgery can be a good option for younger people who cannot have laser eye surgery due to high eye prescriptions or astigmatism. RLE may be better for older individuals.
8,What are the risks and side effects of phakic intraocular lens (PIOL) surgery?,<noinput>,"The risks and side effects of PIOL surgery include temporary vision disturbances, discomfort, glare from headlights at night, and the possibility of developing cataracts earlier in life."
9,What is refractive lens exchange (RLE) and who is it suitable for?,<noinput>,Refractive lens exchange (RLE) is similar to cataract surgery and involves removing the natural lens and replacing it with an artificial lens. RLE may be suitable for older individuals who are not suitable for laser eye surgery.
0,What are the two main types of refractive surgery for improving eyesight?,<noinput>,The two main types of refractive surgery for improving eyesight are laser eye surgery and lens surgery.
1,What does laser eye surgery involve?,Laser eye surgery involves using lasers to reshape the front surface (cornea) of your eyes so that you can focus better.,Laser eye surgery involves using lasers to reshape the front surface (cornea) of the eyes to improve focus.

4,Which type of lens surgery can be a good option for younger people?,<noinput>,Phakic intraocular lens implantation (PIOL) can be a good option for younger people.
5,What does PIOL involve?,PIOL involves placing artificial lenses in the eyes without removing the natural lenses.,PIOL involves placing artificial lenses in the eyes without removing the natural lenses.
6,What is refractive lens exchange (RLE)?,<noinput>,Refractive lens exchange (RLE) is the removal of the natural lens in the eye and its replacement with an artificial lens.
7,Who is RLE suitable for?,<noinput>,RLE may be a good option for older individuals who are not suitable for laser eye surgery and have a high eye prescription or the beginnings of cataracts.
8,What are the two different types of artificial lens used for RLE?,<noinput>,The two different types of artificial lens used for RLE are monofocal and multifocal.
9,What are the risks of RLE surgery?,<noinput>,"The risks of RLE surgery include visual side effects, discomfort, and a 1 in 500 chance of significant loss of vision."
