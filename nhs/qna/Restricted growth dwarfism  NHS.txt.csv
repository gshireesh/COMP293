0,What are the 2 main types of restricted growth?,<noinput>,The two main types of restricted growth are proportionate short stature (PSS) and disproportionate short stature (DSS).
1,What are some physical problems that may occur in people with restricted growth?,<noinput>,Some physical problems that may occur in people with restricted growth include bowed legs and an unusually curved spine.
2,What is the most common cause of proportionate short stature (PSS)?,<noinput>,"The most common cause of PSS is being born to small parents, but it can also be due to the body not producing enough growth hormone."
3,What is the most common cause of disproportionate short stature (DSS)?,<noinput>,"The most common cause of DSS is a rare genetic condition called achondroplasia, which results in poor bone growth."
4,How is growth hormone deficiency diagnosed?,<noinput>,"Growth hormone deficiency is usually diagnosed using growth hormone stimulation tests, where medicine is injected to induce the release of growth hormone. A lower than normal level indicates a deficiency."
5,What is the role of the pituitary gland in growth hormone deficiency diagnosis?,<noinput>,"If blood tests for growth hormone deficiency show low levels of growth hormone, a brain scan will be needed to examine the pituitary gland, which produces growth hormone."
6,Can restricted growth be diagnosed during pregnancy?,<noinput>,"If one or both parents have a family history of a condition causing short stature, the baby can be tested for it during pregnancy through prenatal diagnosis."
7,How can growth hormone injections help with restricted growth?,<noinput>,Growth hormone injections can benefit some people with restricted growth by stimulating growth and helping a child with the condition grow more than they would without treatment.
8,What is a potential treatment for disproportionate short stature (DSS) with particularly short legs?,<noinput>,"In cases of DSS with short legs, a leg-lengthening procedure is sometimes used, although its safety and effectiveness are uncertain."
9,Where can I find more information about achondroplasia and other rare types of restricted growth?,<noinput>,The Restricted Growth Association UK has more information about achondroplasia and other rare types of restricted growth.

2,What is the most common cause of proportionate short stature (PSS)?,<noinput>,"The most common cause of PSS is being born to small parents, but it can also be the result of the body not producing enough growth hormone. Certain genetic syndromes can also cause PSS."
3,What is the most common cause of disproportionate short stature (DSS)?,<noinput>,"The most common cause of DSS is a rare genetic condition called achondroplasia, which results in poor bone growth and short upper arms and thighs."
4,Can restricted growth be diagnosed before a child is born?,<noinput>,"Yes, restricted growth can be diagnosed before a child is born, soon afterwards, or when growth problems become more obvious as they get older."
5,How is growth hormone deficiency diagnosed?,<noinput>,"Growth hormone deficiency is usually diagnosed using growth hormone stimulation tests, where medicine is injected to stimulate growth hormone production and a blood test is done to measure growth hormone levels."
6,What is a possible treatment for restricted growth?,<noinput>,"One possible treatment for restricted growth is growth hormone injections, which can help a child with the condition grow more than they otherwise would."
7,Is the leg-lengthening procedure commonly used for treating restricted growth?,<noinput>,"The leg-lengthening procedure is sometimes used for treating restricted growth in cases where the legs are particularly short, but there is some uncertainty about its safety and effectiveness."
8,Can a prenatal diagnosis be done for conditions that cause short stature?,<noinput>,"Yes, if one or both parents have a family history of a condition that causes short stature, their baby can be tested for this during pregnancy."
9,Where can I find more information about achondroplasia and other rare types of restricted growth?,<noinput>,You can find more information about achondroplasia and other rare types of restricted growth from the Restricted Growth Association UK.
