0,What is Glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1)?,<noinput>,"GA1 is a rare inherited condition where the body is unable to process certain amino acids, leading to a harmful build-up of substances in the blood and urine."
1,How is GA1 diagnosed?,<noinput>,"GA1 can be diagnosed through newborn blood spot screening, which involves collecting drops of blood from the baby's heel to test for the condition."
2,What are the symptoms of GA1?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of GA1 may include macrocephaly (larger-than-average head), muscle weakness or floppiness (hypotonia), and the risk of bleeding around the brain or eyes."
3,What is a metabolic crisis in GA1?,<noinput>,"A metabolic crisis in GA1 refers to episodes where the child experiences poor feeding, lack of energy, abnormal movements, vomiting, irritability, or breathing difficulties. Immediate medical help is needed in such situations."
4,How is GA1 treated?,<noinput>,"GA1 is treated through a low-protein diet, monitoring and measuring breastfeeding or baby milk, and the use of medication like L-carnitine. In case of an infection or illness, emergency treatment involving high-sugar drinks may be necessary."
5,How is GA1 inherited?,<noinput>,"GA1 is inherited through autosomal recessive inheritance, where the affected gene must be passed on from both parents for the condition to develop."
6,What are the chances of a baby developing GA1 if both parents are carriers?,<noinput>,"If both parents are carriers of the affected gene, there is a 25% chance of the baby developing GA1, a 50% chance of being a carrier, and a 25% chance of receiving unaffected genes."
7,What should you do if your baby shows symptoms of a metabolic crisis?,<noinput>,"If your baby shows symptoms of a metabolic crisis, such as irritability or breathing difficulties, it is important to seek immediate medical help and follow the emergency treatment instructions provided by your doctor."
8,Can GA1 be prevented?,<noinput>,"It is not possible to prevent GA1, but if you have a family history of the condition, further testing can be done on your future children for early diagnosis and appropriate treatment."
9,What happens to the information about you or your child with GA1?,<noinput>,Information about individuals with GA1 is shared with the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) to aid in research and improve prevention and treatment methods. Opting out of the register is possible.

1,How is GA1 diagnosed?,Babies are offered newborn blood spot screening around 5 days old to check for GA1. Drops of blood are collected from the baby's heel to test for the condition.,"GA1 can be diagnosed through newborn blood spot screening, where drops of blood are collected from the baby's heel and tested for the condition."

3,What is a metabolic crisis in GA1?,<noinput>,"A metabolic crisis in GA1 refers to episodes where a child experiences poor feeding, lack of energy, abnormal movements, vomiting, irritability, or breathing difficulties. Immediate medical help is crucial if these symptoms occur."
4,How is GA1 treated?,"Children diagnosed with GA1 are given a low-protein diet and prescribed L-carnitine medication to help clear excess glutaric acid. In case of infection, emergency diet changes may be required.","GA1 is treated with a low-protein diet, L-carnitine medication, and emergency diet changes during infections. Regular monitoring and consultation with a dietitian are essential."
5,How is GA1 inherited?,<noinput>,"GA1 is inherited through autosomal recessive inheritance, where a child needs to receive two copies of the affected gene from both parents to develop the condition."
6,Can GA1 be prevented?,"Although it's not possible to prevent GA1, babies can be tested for the condition if there is a family history, and appropriate treatment can be given.","Unfortunately, GA1 cannot be prevented, but babies can be tested if there is a family history, and early treatment can be provided."
7,What information is passed on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) for GA1?,<noinput>,"If you or your child has GA1, information about you/your child will be passed on to NCARDRS to contribute to research on prevention and treatment of this condition."
8,Can I opt out of the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) for GA1?,<noinput>,"Yes, you have the option to opt out of the NCARDRS at any time if you do not wish to participate in the registry."
9,Where can I find more information about NCARDRS?,<noinput>,You can find more information about NCARDRS on the GOV.UK website.
