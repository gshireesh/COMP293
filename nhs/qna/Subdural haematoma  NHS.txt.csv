0,What is a subdural haematoma?,<noinput>,"A subdural haematoma is a serious condition where blood collects between the skull and the surface of the brain, usually caused by a head injury."
1,What are the symptoms of a subdural haematoma?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of a subdural haematoma can include headache, nausea, confusion, personality changes, feeling drowsy, and loss of consciousness."
2,When should I seek medical advice for a subdural haematoma?,<noinput>,"You should always seek emergency medical treatment after a severe head injury. If you develop symptoms after a minor head injury, you should also go to the nearest A&E department or call 999."
3,What causes a subdural haematoma?,<noinput>,"A subdural haematoma occurs when a blood vessel in the space between the skull and the brain is damaged, often due to severe head injuries. Minor bumps to the head can also cause a subdural haematoma in some cases."
4,How are subdural haematomas treated?,<noinput>,"Subdural haematomas usually require surgery. The two most common surgical techniques are craniotomy and burr holes. In some cases, small haematomas may be monitored first to see if they heal on their own."
5,What is the outlook for a subdural haematoma?,<noinput>,"A subdural haematoma carries a high risk of death, especially in older people and those with severe brain damage. Recovery can take a long time and physical and cognitive problems may persist. The outlook is generally better for subacute and chronic haematomas."
6,How are subdural haematomas diagnosed?,<noinput>,A subdural haematoma is diagnosed using imaging tests such as CT scans or MRI. Medical history and physical examination are also important for diagnosis.
7,Can a subdural haematoma heal without surgery?,<noinput>,"In some cases, very small subdural haematomas may heal on their own without surgery and are carefully monitored."
8,Who is at higher risk of developing a subdural haematoma?,<noinput>,"Older individuals, those taking anticoagulant medication, and people who have a history of alcohol misuse are at higher risk of developing a subdural haematoma."
9,What are the long-term effects of a subdural haematoma?,<noinput>,"Long-term effects of a subdural haematoma can include physical disabilities, cognitive problems such as memory and speech difficulties, and a longer recovery period."
0,What are the symptoms of a subdural haematoma?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of a subdural haematoma can include a headache that keeps getting worse, feeling and being sick, confusion, personality changes, feeling drowsy, and loss of consciousness."
1,When should I seek medical advice for a subdural haematoma?,<noinput>,"You should seek emergency medical treatment after a severe head injury. If you develop symptoms after a minor head injury, you should also go to the nearest A&E department or call 999 for an ambulance."
2,What causes subdural haematomas?,<noinput>,"A subdural haematoma occurs when a blood vessel in the space between the skull and the brain is damaged, usually due to a severe head injury. Minor bumps to the head can also cause subdural haematomas in some cases."
3,How are subdural haematomas treated?,<noinput>,"Subdural haematomas usually need to be treated with surgery, either through craniotomy or burr holes. In some cases, small haematomas may be monitored to see if they heal without surgery."
4,What is the outlook for subdural haematomas?,<noinput>,"Subdural haematomas are a serious condition, with a high risk of death, particularly in older people and those with severe brain damage. People who survive may have a long recovery and may experience physical and cognitive problems."
5,Can a subdural haematoma develop after a minor head injury?,<noinput>,"Yes, in some cases, a subdural haematoma can develop after a minor head injury, especially if the person is over 60, taking blood-thinning medicine, or has a history of alcohol misuse."
6,What are the surgical techniques used to treat subdural haematomas?,<noinput>,"The two most widely used surgical techniques for subdural haematomas are craniotomy and burr holes. Craniotomy involves temporarily removing a section of the skull, while burr holes involve drilling a small hole and inserting a tube for drainage."
7,Do subacute and chronic subdural haematomas have a better outlook?,<noinput>,"Yes, the outlook is generally better for subacute and chronic subdural haematomas. Most people who are fit enough to have surgery eventually make a full recovery, although older individuals may be too frail for treatment."
8,Are subdural haematomas more common in older people?,<noinput>,"Subdural haematomas are more common in older people, particularly those over 60. Age, along with taking blood-thinning medicine or having a history of alcohol misuse, can increase the risk of developing a subdural haematoma."
9,What are the long-term effects of an acute subdural haematoma?,<noinput>,Surviving an acute subdural haematoma may lead to a long recovery period and possible physical disabilities and cognitive problems such as memory and speech issues.
