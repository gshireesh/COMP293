0,What are the symptoms of vulval cancer?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of vulval cancer can include persistent itch in the vulva, pain or soreness in the vulva, raised and thickened patches of skin, lump or wart-like growth, bleeding from the vulva, open sore in the vulva, burning pain while peeing, mole on the vulva that changes shape or color. If you notice any changes, it's important to see a GP for investigation."
1,What are the risk factors for vulval cancer?,<noinput>,"The risk of developing vulval cancer is increased with factors such as increasing age, vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), persistent infection with certain types of HPV, skin conditions affecting the vulva (e.g., lichen sclerosus), and smoking. Stopping smoking and reducing the chances of picking up an HPV infection can help reduce the risk."
2,How is vulval cancer treated?,<noinput>,"The main treatment for vulval cancer is surgery to remove cancerous tissue from the vulva and affected lymph nodes. Radiotherapy or chemotherapy may also be used, either alone or in combination, depending on the individual's condition. In certain cases, non-surgical treatments may be considered."
3,What factors affect the outlook for vulval cancer?,<noinput>,"The outlook for vulval cancer depends on various factors, including the stage of cancer, age, and overall health. Early detection and younger age generally have better treatment success rates. Approximately 7 in every 10 women diagnosed with vulval cancer will survive at least 5 years, but regular follow-up appointments are necessary to monitor for recurrence."
4,Can vulval cancer be prevented?,<noinput>,"While it may not be possible to completely prevent vulval cancer, certain steps can be taken to reduce the risk. This includes practicing safer sex, attending cervical screening appointments, and stopping smoking. Additionally, HPV vaccination can also lower the chances of developing vulval cancer."
5,What are the components of the vulva?,<noinput>,"The vulva includes the lips surrounding the vagina (labia minora and labia majora), the clitoris, and the Bartholin's glands. These components collectively form a woman's external genitals."
6,What causes abnormal cells in the vulva that can lead to vulval cancer?,<noinput>,"Vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) is a condition where the cells in the vulva become abnormal, putting them at risk of turning into cancerous cells. The exact cause of VIN is unclear, but factors such as persistent infection with certain types of HPV and skin conditions affecting the vulva (e.g., lichen sclerosus) may contribute to its development."
7,What are the treatments options for vulval cancer if surgery is not possible?,<noinput>,"In cases where surgery is not possible, radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be used as alternative treatment options for vulval cancer. These treatments aim to destroy cancer cells using radiation or medication. The specific approach will depend on individual circumstances and the extent of the cancer."
8,What are the chances of vulval cancer recurring after successful treatment?,<noinput>,"Even after successful treatment, there is a possibility of vulval cancer recurrence. Regular follow-up appointments with a doctor are crucial to monitor for any signs of cancer returning. The frequency and duration of follow-up appointments will be determined by the medical team based on individual factors."
9,At what age is HPV vaccination offered to reduce the chances of developing vulval cancer?,<noinput>,"The HPV vaccination, which can help reduce the chances of developing vulval cancer, is now offered to all girls and boys who are 12 to 13 years old as part of the routine childhood immunisation programme."
0,What are the symptoms of vulval cancer?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of vulval cancer can include: a persistent itch in the vulva, pain, soreness or tenderness in the vulva, raised and thickened patches of skin that can be red, white or dark, a lump or wart-like growth on the vulva, bleeding from the vulva or blood-stained vaginal discharge between periods, an open sore in the vulva, a burning pain when peeing, a mole on the vulva that changes shape or colour."
1,What causes vulval cancer?,<noinput>,"The exact cause of vulval cancer is unclear, but risk factors include increasing age, vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), persistent infection with certain versions of the human papillomavirus (HPV), skin conditions affecting the vulva, such as lichen sclerosus, and smoking."
2,How is vulval cancer treated?,<noinput>,The main treatment for vulval cancer is surgery to remove the cancerous tissue from the vulva and any lymph nodes containing cancerous cells. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy may also be used.
3,What is the outlook for vulval cancer?,<noinput>,"The outlook for vulval cancer depends on factors such as the stage of cancer, age, and general health. Generally, the earlier the cancer is detected and the younger the patient, the better the chances of successful treatment."
4,Is it possible to prevent vulval cancer?,<noinput>,"It's not thought to be possible to prevent vulval cancer completely, but measures such as practicing safer sex, attending cervical screening appointments, and stopping smoking may reduce the risk. HPV vaccination may also reduce the chances of developing vulval cancer."
5,What are the risk factors for developing vulval cancer?,<noinput>,"The risk of developing vulval cancer is increased with factors such as increasing age, vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), persistent infection with certain versions of the human papillomavirus (HPV), skin conditions affecting the vulva, such as lichen sclerosus, and smoking."
6,What are the treatment options for vulval cancer?,<noinput>,The main treatment for vulval cancer is surgery to remove the cancerous tissue from the vulva and any affected lymph nodes. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy may also be used in some cases.
7,What is the survival rate for vulval cancer?,<noinput>,"The survival rate for vulval cancer varies depending on factors such as the stage of cancer, age, and general health. Around 7 in every 10 women diagnosed with vulval cancer will survive at least 5 years."
8,What are the symptoms of vulval cancer?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of vulval cancer can include a persistent itch in the vulva, pain, soreness or tenderness in the vulva, raised and thickened patches of skin that can be red, white or dark, a lump or wart-like growth on the vulva, bleeding from the vulva or blood-stained vaginal discharge between periods, an open sore in the vulva, a burning pain when peeing, a mole on the vulva that changes shape or colour."
9,How can vulval cancer be detected?,<noinput>,"Vulval cancer can be detected through symptoms such as persistent itch, pain, or changes in the appearance of the vulva. It is important to see a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis."
