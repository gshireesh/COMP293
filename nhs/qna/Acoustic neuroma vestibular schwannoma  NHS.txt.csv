0,What is an acoustic neuroma?,<noinput>,"An acoustic neuroma is a type of non-cancerous brain tumor that grows on the nerve used for hearing and balance. It can cause symptoms such as hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo."
1,What are the symptoms of acoustic neuroma?,<noinput>,"The symptoms of acoustic neuroma can include hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, headaches, blurred vision, numbness or weakness on one side of the face, problems with limb coordination, voice changes, and difficulty swallowing."
2,How can I get medical advice for acoustic neuroma?,<noinput>,"If you have persistent or troublesome symptoms that you think might be caused by an acoustic neuroma, it's important to see your GP. They can refer you to a hospital or clinic for further tests such as hearing tests, MRI scans, or CT scans."
3,What are the treatment options for acoustic neuromas?,<noinput>,"The treatment options for acoustic neuromas include monitoring the tumor with regular MRI scans, brain surgery to remove all or part of the tumor, and stereotactic radiosurgery using radiation to stop the tumor from growing."
4,What are the risks of treatments for acoustic neuromas?,<noinput>,"Treatments for acoustic neuromas, such as surgery and radiosurgery, carry some risks. These can include facial numbness, paralysis of facial muscles, and other complications. It's important to discuss the benefits and risks with a specialist."
5,What is the outlook for acoustic neuromas?,<noinput>,"Acoustic neuromas can be serious if they cause a build-up of fluid in the brain, but this is rare. With proper treatment, most neuromas grow slowly or not at all. However, symptoms like hearing loss and tinnitus can persist and may require additional treatment."
6,Is it common for acoustic neuromas to return after treatment?,<noinput>,"The recurrence of acoustic neuromas after treatment is rare, occurring in about 1 in every 20 people who have had surgical removal. Regular MRI scans are usually done to monitor the tumor for any signs of regrowth."
7,What causes acoustic neuromas?,<noinput>,"The exact cause of acoustic neuromas is unknown. They most commonly occur without any obvious cause, although a small number of cases are associated with a genetic condition called neurofibromatosis type 2."
8,Can acoustic neuromas cause problems with balance?,Acoustic neuromas grow on the nerve used for hearing and balance. They can cause problems such as hearing loss and unsteadiness.,"Yes, acoustic neuromas can cause problems with balance, as they grow on the nerve responsible for balance. This can result in unsteadiness or a sensation of spinning (vertigo)."
9,Do all symptoms of acoustic neuromas develop gradually?,Symptoms of an acoustic neuroma tend to develop gradually.,"Yes, most symptoms of an acoustic neuroma develop gradually over time. These symptoms can include hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, headaches, and other signs mentioned earlier."
0,What is an acoustic neuroma?,<noinput>,"An acoustic neuroma is a type of non-cancerous brain tumor that grows on the nerve used for hearing and balance. It can cause symptoms such as hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo."
1,What are the symptoms of an acoustic neuroma?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of an acoustic neuroma may include hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, headaches, blurred or double vision, numbness, weakness, and voice changes or difficulty swallowing."
2,How is an acoustic neuroma diagnosed?,<noinput>,"An acoustic neuroma can be difficult to diagnose. It usually requires a referral to a hospital or clinic for further tests such as hearing tests, MRI scans, and CT scans."
3,What are the treatment options for an acoustic neuroma?,<noinput>,"Treatment options for an acoustic neuroma include monitoring the tumor, brain surgery, and stereotactic radiosurgery. The best option depends on the size, position, and growth rate of the tumor."
4,What are the risks associated with treating an acoustic neuroma?,<noinput>,"Treatments such as surgery and radiosurgery carry some risks, including facial numbness and paralysis. It is important to discuss the benefits and risks with a specialist."
5,What is the outlook for acoustic neuromas?,<noinput>,"Most acoustic neuromas grow slowly or not at all. Even with treatment, symptoms like hearing loss and tinnitus can persist. Regular MRI scans are usually recommended to monitor the tumor."
6,When should I seek medical advice for symptoms that could be caused by an acoustic neuroma?,<noinput>,"If you have persistent or troublesome symptoms such as hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, headaches, or vision problems, it is recommended to see your GP for further evaluation."
7,Can an acoustic neuroma be caused by a genetic condition?,<noinput>,A small number of acoustic neuroma cases are the result of a genetic condition called neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2).
8,How can an acoustic neuroma affect daily life?,<noinput>,"An acoustic neuroma can affect daily life by causing hearing loss, difficulty balancing, and other symptoms that may impact work, communication, and driving."
9,Can an acoustic neuroma come back after treatment?,<noinput>,"In some cases, an acoustic neuroma can return after surgical removal. Regular MRI scans are usually done after treatment to monitor for any recurrence."
