0,What is homocystinuria?,<noinput>,"Homocystinuria is a rare inherited condition where the body cannot process the amino acid methionine, leading to a harmful build-up of substances in the blood and urine."
1,How is homocystinuria diagnosed?,<noinput>,Babies are offered a newborn blood spot test at around 5 days old to check for homocystinuria. This involves collecting drops of blood from the baby's heel.
2,What are the symptoms of untreated homocystinuria?,<noinput>,"Untreated homocystinuria can lead to symptoms such as vision problems, weak bones, bone and joint problems, and a risk of developing blood clots and strokes. It can also affect brain development in children."
3,How is homocystinuria treated?,<noinput>,"Homocystinuria can be treated through vitamin B6 supplements or a low-protein diet. In some cases, a medicine called betaine may also be prescribed to help clear excess homocysteine."
4,How is homocystinuria inherited?,<noinput>,"Homocystinuria is inherited through autosomal recessive inheritance, where a person needs to receive two copies of the mutated gene to develop the condition. If a person only receives one affected gene, they will be a carrier of the condition."
5,What are the chances of passing on homocystinuria to a baby?,<noinput>,"If both parents are carriers of the mutated gene, there is a 1 in 4 chance of the baby developing homocystinuria, a 2 in 4 chance of the baby being a carrier, and a 1 in 4 chance of the baby receiving a pair of normal genes."
6,What should I do if I have a family history of homocystinuria?,<noinput>,"If you have a family history of homocystinuria, it is important to inform your midwife and doctor. Further children can be tested for the condition and given appropriate treatment."
7,What is the role of the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) in homocystinuria?,<noinput>,"If your child has homocystinuria, their information will be passed on to the NCARDRS to help researchers find better ways to prevent and treat the condition."
8,Can I opt out of the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS)?,<noinput>,"Yes, you can opt out of the NCARDRS at any time if you do not wish to have your child's information included in the registry."
9,Where can I find more information about the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS)?,<noinput>,You can find more information about the NCARDRS on the GOV.UK website.

5,What are the chances of passing homocystinuria to a child?,<noinput>,"If both parents are carriers of the mutated gene for homocystinuria, there's a 25% chance their child will develop the condition, a 50% chance of being a carrier, and a 25% chance of receiving normal genes."
6,How can homocystinuria be prevented?,<noinput>,"It's not possible to prevent homocystinuria, but if there's a family history, children can be tested for the condition early on and receive appropriate treatment."
7,What information is passed on about a child with homocystinuria?,<noinput>,Information about a child with homocystinuria is passed on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) to help with research and treatment.
8,Can I opt out of the NCARDRS register?,<noinput>,"Yes, you can opt out of the NCARDRS register at any time if you choose to."
