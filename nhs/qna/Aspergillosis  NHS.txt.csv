0,What are the common symptoms of aspergillosis?,<noinput>,"Common symptoms of aspergillosis include shortness of breath, a cough (which may include coughing up blood or lumps of mucus), wheezing, high temperature, and weight loss. Existing symptoms of a pre-existing lung condition may worsen."
1,How is aspergillosis diagnosed?,<noinput>,"To diagnose aspergillosis, a GP may check for other causes of your symptoms, such as a chest infection or asthma. If the cause is unclear, they may refer you to a specialist for tests like X-rays, scans, blood tests, mucus sample tests, allergy tests, or a bronchoscopy (a procedure to look inside your lungs with a camera)."
2,What is the treatment for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA)?,<noinput>,"The usual treatment for ABPA, an allergic reaction to aspergillus mold, involves taking steroid tablets and antifungal tablets for a few months, possibly longer."
3,How is chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) treated?,<noinput>,"CPA, a long-term lung infection, is typically treated with long-term, possibly lifelong, treatment with antifungal tablets."
4,What is the recommended treatment for an aspergilloma?,<noinput>,"In the case of an aspergilloma, a ball of mold in the lungs often associated with CPA, surgery may be performed to remove the ball if it's causing symptoms, usually after receiving antifungal treatment."
5,How is invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) treated?,<noinput>,"IPA, a life-threatening infection in people with a weakened immune system, is typically treated with antifungal medicine administered directly into a vein in the hospital."
6,Can aspergillosis be prevented?,<noinput>,"It is almost impossible to completely avoid aspergillus mold. However, individuals with a lung condition or weakened immune system can take precautions to reduce the risk of aspergillosis, such as avoiding places where aspergillus mold is often found, closing windows during construction or digging, wearing a face mask in dusty areas, and considering the use of air purifiers with HEPA filters."
7,Is aspergillosis contagious?,<noinput>,"No, aspergillosis is not contagious. It cannot be transmitted from one person to another or from animals."
8,Who is at risk of developing aspergillosis?,<noinput>,"Individuals with a lung condition such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a weakened immune system (e.g., organ transplant recipients, individuals undergoing chemotherapy), a history of tuberculosis, or those who have had severe flu or coronavirus (COVID-19) and needed artificial ventilation are at an increased risk of developing aspergillosis."
9,Where can I find more information about aspergillosis?,<noinput>,You can find more information about aspergillosis on the Aspergillosis Patients and Carers website.
0,What is aspergillosis?,<noinput>,"Aspergillosis is a condition caused by aspergillus mould. Most commonly, it affects the lungs and leads to breathing difficulties."
1,How do you get aspergillosis?,<noinput>,"Aspergillosis is usually caused by inhaling tiny bits of mould found in soil, compost, dust, plants, trees, crops, and damp buildings. It is not contagious and cannot be transmitted from person to person."
2,Who is at risk of aspergillosis?,<noinput>,"People with lung conditions (e.g., asthma, cystic fibrosis), weakened immune systems, a history of tuberculosis, or those who have had severe flu or COVID-19 with artificial ventilation are at higher risk of aspergillosis."
3,What are the symptoms of aspergillosis?,<noinput>,"Symptoms of aspergillosis include shortness of breath, cough (sometimes with blood or mucus), wheezing, high temperature, and weight loss. Existing lung conditions may worsen."
4,When should I see a GP for aspergillosis?,<noinput>,"You should see a GP if you have a persistent cough for more than 3 weeks, worsening lung condition, weakened immune system, or if you cough up blood. If you cannot see your GP, call 111 for advice."
5,What happens at the appointment for aspergillosis?,<noinput>,"During the appointment, your GP will investigate possible causes of your symptoms, such as chest infections or asthma. They may refer you to a specialist for tests like X-rays, scans, blood tests, mucus sample analysis, allergy tests, or bronchoscopy."
6,How is aspergillosis treated?,<noinput>,"Treatment for aspergillosis depends on the type. Common treatments include steroid and antifungal tablets for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), long-term antifungal tablets for chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA), surgery (after antifungal treatment) for aspergilloma, and antifungal medication given intravenously for invasive pulmonary aspergillus (IPA)."
7,Can aspergillosis be prevented?,<noinput>,"It's hard to completely avoid aspergillus mould, but if you have a lung condition or weakened immune system, you can reduce the risk by avoiding places with mould, closing windows during construction or digging, wearing a face mask in dusty environments, and using air purifiers with HEPA filters. Avoid drying laundry inside living areas if possible."
